# RX and TX

## Think of it Like This:
- **RX (Receive):** How much internet you’re **consuming**    
- **TX (Transmit):** How much you’re **uploading or sending**

## Why It Matters
- **High RX:** Streaming, downloading, receiving data from a server.
- **High TX:** Uploading, cloud backup, video calls, torrents.
    
If you're watching a YouTube video, expect high RX and low TX.
