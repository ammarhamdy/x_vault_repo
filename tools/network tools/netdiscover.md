`netdiscover` is a powerful ARP network scanner used to discover devices connected to a local network (LAN).

`netdiscover` table's headers:  
+ `IP`           
+ `At MAC Address`     
+ `Count`     
+ `Len` 
+ `MAC Vendor / Hostname` 

----
# IP

It’s the **Layer 3 (Network layer)** address assigned to the device.
