Change Icons & Shell Theme

The app grid uses your **icon theme** and **GNOME Shell theme**. You can change both with **GNOME Tweaks**:

```sh
sudo apt install gnome-tweaks

```

```sh
sudo apt install papirus-icon-theme
```

- For shell themes, install the **User Themes extension** via Extension Manager.
    
- Then apply themes in **Tweaks → Appearance**.
