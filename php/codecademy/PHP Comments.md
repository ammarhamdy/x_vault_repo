Either `#` or `//` can be used to create a single line comment.

```php
// I will always remember this
echo "Hello world"; // My first PHP statement
```

```php
# I will always remember this  
echo "Hello, World!"; # My first PHP statement
```

The second type of comment is a multi-line comment. 
These comments are started with `/*` and ended with `*/`.
