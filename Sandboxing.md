Isolating a programming environment in this way is called sand-boxing


In computer security, a sandbox is a security mechanism for separating running programs, usually in an effort to mitigate system failures and/or software vulnerabilities from spreading. 

It is often used to execute untested or untrusted programs or code, possibly from unverified or untrusted third parties, suppliers, users or websites, without risking harm to the host machine or operating system. 

A sandbox typically provides a tightly controlled set of resources for guest programs to run in, such as storage and memory scratch space.

Network access, the ability to inspect the host system or read from input devices are usually disallowed or heavily restricted.

In the sense of providing a highly controlled environment, sandboxes may be seen as a specific example of virtualization.

Sand-boxing is frequently used to test unverified programs that may contain a virus or other malicious code, without allowing the software to harm the host device.
