# Defining Information Security

Generally speaking, security means protecting your assets, whether from attackers invading your networks, natural disasters, vandalism, loss, or misuse.

Information security is defined as “protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction,” according to US law.

# When Are You Secure?

`Eugene Spafford` once said, “The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of [concrete and sealed](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=concrete%20and%20sealed&op=translate) in a [lead-lined room](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=lead-lined%20room&op=translate) with armed guards—and even then, I have my doubts.”

**==As you increase the level of security, you usually decrease the level of productivity.==**

==**The cost of the security you put in place should never [outstrip](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=outstrip&op=translate) the value of what it’s protecting.**==

==No **single** activity or action will make you secure in **every** situation.==

When you’re using strong passwords, an attacker will exploit a different avenue instead. When you’re disconnected from the internet, an attacker could still physically access or steal your systems. 
In short, it’s difficult to define when you’re truly secure.

On the other hand, defining when you’re insecure is a much easier task. 
Here are several examples that would put you in this state:
+ Not applying [security patches](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=security%20patches&op=translate) or application updates to your systems.
+ Using weak passwords such as “password” or “1234”
+ Downloading programs from the internet
+ Opening email attachments from unknown senders
+ Using wireless networks without encryption


# Models for Discussing Security Issues

The **==Confidentiality==**, **==Integrity==**, and **==Availability==** Triad (ثلاثية)

Three of the primary concepts in information security are [confidentiality](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=confidentiality&op=translate) (السرية), [integrity](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=integrity&op=translate) (سلامة), and [availability](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=availability&op=translate) (التوفر), commonly known as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (`CIA`) triad

It’s also sometimes written as `CAI` or expressed in its negative form as [disclosure](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=disclosure&op=translate) (الإفصاح), [alteration](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=alteration&op=translate) (تغيير), and [denial](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=denial&op=translate) (إنكار) (`DAD`).


## Confidentiality
Confidentiality refers to our ability to protect our data from those who are not authorized to view it.

## Integrity 
Integrity is the ability to prevent people from changing your data in an unauthorized or undesirable manner.

For the purposes of preventing unauthorized changes, such systems often implement permissions that restrict what actions an unauthorized user can perform on a given file.


## Availability
Availability refers to the ability to access our data when we need it.


# The Parkerian Hexad

The Parkerian hexad, a less well-known model named after `Donn Parker` and introduced in his book `Fighting Computer Crime`, provides a somewhat more complex variation of the classic CIA triad.

Where the CIA triad consists only of ==confidentiality==, ==integrity==, and ==availability==, the Parkerian hexad consists of these three principles as well as ==**possession or control**==, ==**authenticity**== (موثوقية), and ==**utility**== (فائدة).


## Possession or Control
In the Parkerian hexad, possession or control refers to the physical disposition of the media on which the data is stored. 

This enables you to discuss your loss of the data in its physical medium without involving other factors such as availability.


## Authenticity
The principle of authenticity allows you to say whether you’ve attributed the data in question to the proper owner or creator.

For example, if you send an email message that is altered so that it appears to have come from a different email address than the one from which it was actually sent, you would be violating the authenticity of the email.

==Authenticity can be enforced using **digital signatures**.==

A similar, but reversed, concept to this is [nonrepudiation](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=nonrepudiation&op=translate), which prevents people from taking an action, such as sending an email and then later denying that they have done so.


## Utility
==Finally, utility refers to how **useful** the data is to you.==

Utility is also the only principle of the Parkerian hexad that is not necessarily binary in nature; you can have a variety of degrees of utility, depending on the data and its format.


# Attacks
You can break these down according to the type of attack, the risk the attack represents, and the controls you might use to mitigate it.

## Types of Attacks
You can generally place attacks into one of four categories: **==interception==** (اعتراض), **==interruption==** (انقطاع), **==modification==** (تعديل), and **==fabrication==** (تلفيق). 
Each of the categories can affect one or more of the principles of the CIA triad


## Interception
==Interception attacks allow unauthorized users to access your data==, applications, or environments, and they are primarily attacks against confidentiality. 

Interception might take the form of unauthorized file viewing or copying, eavesdropping on phone conversations, or reading someone else’s email, and you can conduct it against data at rest or in motion.

### DATA AT REST AND IN MOTION
**==Data at rest==** ___is stored data that is not in the process of being moved from one place to another.___
It may be on a hard drive or flash drive, or it may be stored in a database, for example.
This type of data is generally protected with some sort of encryption, often at the level of the file or entire storage device.

**==Data in motion==** ___is data that is moving from one place to another.___ 
When you are using your online banking session, the sensitive data flowing between your web browser and your bank is data in motion. 
Data in motion is also protected by encryption, but in this case the encryption protects the network protocol or path used to move the data from one place to another.

Some may also posit a third category, data in use. 
**==Data in use==** ___would be data that an application or individual was actively accessing or modifying.___ 
Protections on data in use would include permissions and authentication of users.


## Interruption
==Interruption attacks make your assets **unusable** or **unavailable** to you on a temporary or permanent basis.==

These attacks often affect availability but can affect integrity, as well. 
You would classify a DoS attack on a mail server as an availability attack.


## Modification
==Modification attacks involve **tampering** with an asset.== 

Such attacks might primarily be considered attacks on integrity but could also represent attacks on availability.

If you access a file in an unauthorized manner and alter the data it contains, you’ve affected the integrity of the file’s data.

However, if the file in question is a configuration file that manages how a service behaves perhaps one that is acting as a web server changing the contents of the file might affect the availability of that service.


## Fabrication
==Fabrication attacks involve **generating data**, **processes**, **communications**, or other similar material with a system.==

Fabrication attacks primarily affect integrity but could affect availability, as well.

**==Generating fake information in a database would be a kind of fabrication attack.==**



# Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risk

## Threats
==Ultimately, a threat is something that has the **potential to cause harm**.==

## Vulnerabilities
==Vulnerabilities are **weaknesses**, or **holes**, that threats can exploit to cause you harm.==

## Risk
==Risk is the [likelihood](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=likelihood&op=translate) that something bad will happen.==

For you to have a risk in an environment, you need to have both a threat and a vulnerability that the threat could exploit.

**For example**
If you have a structure that is made from wood and you light a fire nearby, you have both a threat (the fire) and a matching vulnerability (the wood structure).
In this case, you most definitely have a risk.
Likewise, if you have the same threat of fire but your structure is made of concrete, you no longer have a credible risk because your threat doesn’t have a vulnerability to exploit.

## Impact
Some organizations, such as the US National Security Agency (NSA), add a factor to the threat/vulnerability/risk equation called impact. 
==Impact takes into account the **value of the asset being threatened** and uses it to calculate risk.==



# Risk Management

Identify assets -> Identify threats -> Assess vulnerabilities -> Assess risks -> Mitigate risks.


### Identify Assets
You need to identify your important assets.
Most important parts of the risk management process is identifying the assets you’re protecting.


### Identify Threats
After enumerating your critical assets, you can then begin to identify the threats that might affect them.


### Assess Vulnerabilities
Any given asset may have thousands or millions of threats that could impact it, but only a small fraction of these will be relevant.


### Assess Risks
Once you’ve identified the threats and vulnerabilities for a given asset, you can assess the overall risk. 
Risk is the conjunction of a threat and a vulnerability.
==**A vulnerability with no matching threat or a threat with no matching vulnerability does not constitute a risk.**==


If the system or application goes down, you can’t process payments. 
You don’t have redundancy for the database on the back end of your payment processing system, so if the database goes down, you won’t be able to process payments.
In this case, you have both a threat and a corresponding vulnerability, meaning you ==risk losing ability to process credit card payments because of a single point of failure on your database back end.==


### Mitigate Risks
To mitigate risks, you can put measures in place to account for each threat. 

These measures are called controls. 

Controls are divided into three categories: ==physical==, ==logical==, and ==administrative==.

**Physical controls** protect the physical environment in which your systems sit, or where your data is stored.

**Logical controls**, sometimes called technical controls, protect the systems, networks, and environments that process, transmit, and store your data.
**Logical controls** can include items such as passwords, encryption, access controls, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.

**Administrative controls** are based on ==rules==, ==laws==, ==policies==, ==procedures==, ==guidelines==, and other items that are “paper” in nature. 
**Administrative controls** dictate how the users of your environment should behave.


# Defense in Depth

Defense in depth is a strategy common to both military maneuvers and information security. 

The basic concept is to formulate a multilayered defense that will allow you to still mount a successful resistance should one or more of your defensive measures fail.

You can see an example of layers you might want to put in place to defend your assets (طبقات التي قد ترغب في وضعها).

![[Pasted image 20250203115002.png]]The goal is to place enough defensive measures between your truly important assets and the attacker so that you’ll notice that an attack is in progress and have enough time to prevent it.
