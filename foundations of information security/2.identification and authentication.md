identification makes a claim about what someone or something is, and authentication [establishes](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=establishes&op=translate) whether this claim is true.

One common example of an identification and authentication transaction is the use of payment cards that require a personal identification number (PIN). 

When you swipe the magnetic strip on the card, you’re asserting that you’re [the person indicated on the card](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=the%20person%20indicated%20on%20the%20card&op=translate). 

At this point, you’ve given your identification, but nothing more.

==When you’re prompted to enter the PIN associated with the card, you’re completing the authentication portion of the transaction.==


# Identification
Identification, is simply an assertion of ==**who we are**==.

This may include who we claim to be as people, who a system claims to be over the network, or who the originating party of an email claims to be.


## Who We Claim to Be
Who we claim to be is a [tenuous](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=tenuous&op=translate) concept at best.

We can identify ourselves by our full names, shortened versions of our names, nicknames, account numbers, usernames, ID cards, fingerprints, or DNA samples.

Unfortunately, with a few exceptions, such methods of identification are not unique.

==One of the most crucial factors to realize is that a claim of identity alone is not enough.==


## Identity Verification
Identity verification is a step beyond identification, but it’s still a step short of authentication.

==When you’re asked to show a driver’s license, Social Security card, birth certificate, or other similar form of identification, this is generally for **identity verification**, **not authentication**==.

It’s the rough equivalent of someone claiming the identity John Smith; you asking if the person is indeed John Smith and being satisfied with an answer of “Sure, I am” from the person (plus a little paperwork).

We can take the example a bit further and validate the form of identification (say, a passport) against a database holding an additional copy of the information that it contains, matching the photograph and physical specifications with the person standing in front of us. 
This may get us a bit closer to ensuring we’ve correctly identified the person, but it still doesn’t qualify as authentication.


## Falsifying Identification
You could use some methods of identification, such as birth certificates, to gain additional forms of identification, such as Social Security cards or driver’s licenses, thus strengthening a false identity.

Although most people think identity verification is [sufficient](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=sufficient&op=translate), verification is easy to [circumvent](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=circumvent&op=translate) (سيركنفنت) by using falsified forms of identification.




# Authentication
==**Authentication is the set of methods used to establish whether a claim of identity is true**==.

==**Note that authentication does not decide what the party being authenticated is permitted to do; this is a separate task, known as authorization**==.


## Factors
There are several approaches to authentication: ==something you know==, ==something you are==, ==something you have==, ==something you do==, and ==where you are==.

**==The more factors you use, the more positive your results will be==**.

**something you** are is a factor based on the relatively unique physical attributes of an individual, often referred to as `biometrics`.
Fingerprints, iris or retina patterns, or facial characteristics are more common.

**Something you have** is a factor generally based on a physical possession.
Common examples are automatic teller machine (ATM) cards or software-based security tokens.

**Something you do** sometimes considered a variation of something you are, is a factor based on the actions or behaviors of an individual. 
This may include an analysis of the individual’s gait or handwriting or of the time delay between keystrokes as he or she types a passphrase.

**Where you are** is a geographically based authentication factor.


## Multifactor Authentication
Let’s return to the ATM example because it illustrates multifactor authentication well.
In this case, you use something you know (your PIN) and something you have (your ATM card). 
Your ATM card serves as both a factor for authentication and a form of identification.


## Mutual Authentication
[Mutual](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=Mutual&op=translate) authentication is an authentication mechanism in which both parties in a transaction authenticate each other. 
These parties are typically software-based.

In mutual authentication, not only does the client authenticate to the server, but the server authenticates to the client.

**==Briefly, both the client and the server would have a certificate to authenticate the other==**.

In cases where you don’t perform mutual authentication, you leave yourself open to **impersonation attacks**, often referred to as **man-in-the middle attacks**.


# Common Identification and Authentication Methods

## Passwords
passwords can represent a relatively high level of security when constructed and implemented [properly](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=properly&op=translate).


## Biometrics
Although some biometric identifiers may be more difficult to falsify than others, this is only because of the limitations of today’s technology. 

At some point in the future, we’ll need to develop more robust biometric characteristics to measure or else ==**stop** using biometrics as an authentication mechanism==.

### Characteristics of Biometric Factors
Biometric factors are defined by seven characteristics: 
+ [universality](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=universality&op=translate) (عالمية)
+ [uniqueness](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=uniqueness&op=translate) (التفرد)
+ [permanence](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=permanence&op=translate) (الدوام)
+ [collectability](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=collectability&op=translate) (قابلية التحصيل)
+ [performance](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=performance&op=translate) (أداء)
+ [acceptability](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=acceptability&op=translate) (القبول)
+ [circumvention](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=circumvention&op=translate) (, إبطال, التحايل).

**Universality** means you should be able to find your chosen biometric characteristic in the majority of people you expect to enroll in the system.

**Uniqueness** is a measure of how unique a characteristic is among individuals. 
For example, if you choose to use height or weight as a biometric identifier, you’d stand a good chance of finding several people in any given group who have the same height or weight.

**Permanence** tests how well a characteristic resists change over time and with advancing age. 
If you choose a factor that can easily vary, such as height, weight, or hand geometry, you’ll eventually find yourself unable to authenticate a legitimate user.

**Collectability** measures how easy it is to acquire a characteristic. 
Most commonly used biometrics, such as fingerprints, are relatively easy to acquire, which is one reason they are common.
On the other hand, a DNA sample is more difficult to acquire because the user must provide a genetic sample to enroll and to authenticate again later.

**Performance** measures how well a given system functions based on factors such as speed, accuracy, and error rate.

**Acceptability** is a measure of how acceptable the characteristic is to the users of the system.

**Circumvention** describes how easy it is to trick a system by using a falsified biometric identifier.
==The classic example of a circumvention attack against the fingerprint as a biometric identifier is the “**gummy finger**”==.
In this type of attack, a fingerprint is lifted from a surface and used to create a mold with which the attacker can cast a positive image of the fingerprint in gelatin.
Some biometric systems have secondary features specifically designed to defeat such attacks by measuring skin temperature, pulse, or pupillary response.

### Measuring Performance
There are many ways to measure the performance of a biometric system, but a few primary metrics are particularly important. 
==**The false acceptance rate (FAR)**== and **==false rejection rate (FRR)==** are two of these.

**FAR** ___measures how often you accept a user who should be rejected.___
___This is also called a false positive.___

**FRR** ___measures how often we reject a legitimate user and is sometimes called a false negative.___

You want to avoid both of these situations in excess. 

You should aim for a balance between the two error types, referred to as an equal error rate (`EER`).

# Hardware Tokens
A standard hardware token is a small device, typically in the general form factor (size and shape) of a credit card or key-chain fob.

![[Pasted image 20250204100606.png]]

The simplest hardware tokens look identical to universal serial bus (USB) flash drives and contain a certificate or unique identifier.

==They’re often called dongles.==

Many hardware tokens contain an internal clock that generates a code based on the device’s unique identifier, an input PIN or password, and other potential factors.

Usually, the code is output to a display on the token and changes on a regular basis, often every 30 seconds.

The infrastructure used to keep track of these tokens can predict what the proper output will be at any given time in order to authenticate the user





# Summary 
**Identification** is an assertion of the identity of some party, whether it be a person, process, system, or other entity. Identification is only a claim of identity; it doesn’t say anything about any privileges that might be associated with the identity.

**Authentication** is the process used to validate whether the claim of identity is correct. 
It’s different than ==verification==, which ==is a much weaker way of testing someone’s identity==.

The common set of tools used for authentication includes passwords, tokens, and biometric identifiers.
