# Kerckhoffs’s Principles
Kerckhoffs outlined six principles he thought should serve as a basis for all cryptographic systems.

+ The system must be [substantially](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=substantially&op=translate), if not mathematically, undecipherable.

+ The system must not require [secrecy](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=secrecy&op=translate); even if stolen by the enemy, the system should ==remain secure==.

+ The keys must be easy to communicate and remember without written notes, and they must be easy to change or modify to use with different participants.

+ The system [ought to be compatible](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=ought%20to%20be%20compatible&op=translate) with communication via telegraph.

+ The system must be portable, and its use ==must not require more than one person==.

+ Finally, the system ==must be **easy** to use==, requiring neither complex thinking nor the knowledge of a long series of rules.

# Modern Cryptographic Tools
Modern cryptographic algorithms used by computers are truly open, meaning you can understand the encryption process and still not be able to break the cipher.

These algorithms depend on difficult mathematical problems, sometimes referred to as one-way problems. 

One-way problems are easy to perform in one direction but difficult to perform in the other direction.

==Factorization== of large numbers is an example of a one-way problem; it’s easy to create an algorithm that returns a product of multiple integers, but it’s much more difficult to create one that does the inverse of that operation— finding the factors of a given integer.

## Keyword Ciphers and One-Time Pads
Two technologies, keyword ciphers and one-time pads, helped bridge the gap between older cryptographic methods and modern ones.

Although simpler than the algorithms used today, these techniques increasingly met the standard set by Kerckhoffs’s second principle.

### Keyword Ciphers
Keyword ciphers are substitution ciphers, like the Caesar cipher.

But, unlike the Caesar cipher, they use a key to determine what to substitute for each letter of the message.

Rather than shifting all letters by the same number of spaces in the alphabet, you’d shift each letter to match the corresponding letter in the keyword.

For example:
![[Pasted image 20250213165750.png]]

The letter A turns into the letter M, which is the first letter in the key; the letter B turns into the letter Y, which is the second letter in the key. 

You continue like this, removing any repeating letters in the key notice the ==second E in SECRET is missing== and once the keyword ends, you assign the rest of the characters are in alphabetical order, minus any letter used in the key.

If you started with the plaintext:
`THE QUICK BROWN FOX` 
you’d get the ciphertext:
`PAC LQBSF YNJVI RJW`

## Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography
Today, we can separate most **==cryptographic algorithms==** into two types: symmetric and asymmetric.

### Symmetric Cryptography
Also known as private key cryptography, symmetric key cryptography uses a ==**single** key== to both encrypt the plaintext and decrypt the ciphertext.
That means you must share the key between the sender and the receiver.
This process, known as ==key exchange==.

The fact that you must ==share== a single key among all users of the system is one of the chief ==weaknesses== of symmetric key cryptography.

### Block vs. Stream Ciphers
Symmetric key cryptography in the digital age makes use of two types of ciphers: block ciphers and stream ciphers.

**A block cipher** takes a predetermined number of bits (or binary digits, which are either a 1 or a 0), known as a block, and encrypts that block.

**A stream cipher** encrypts each bit in the plaintext message one bit at a time.
You can make a block cipher act as a stream cipher by setting the block size to one bit.

==The **majority** of the encryption algorithms currently in use are block ciphers==.


### Symmetric Key Algorithms
Some of the most well-known cryptographic algorithms are symmetric key algorithms. 

The US government has used several of these, such as `DES`, `3DES`, and `AES`, as standard algorithms for protecting highly sensitive data.

`DES` is a block cipher that uses a 56-bit key (meaning the key used by its cryptographic algorithm is 56 bits long).

As you saw when discussing keyword ciphers, ==**the length of the key determines the strength of the algorithm**==.

`3DES` (pronounced “triple `DES`”), which is simply `DES` used to encrypt each block three times, with three different keys.

Eventually, the US government replaced `DES` with `AES`, a set of symmetric block ciphers.
US government still considers `AES` to be secure.

Other well-known symmetric block ciphers include `Twofish`, `Serpent`, `Blowfish`, `CAST5`, `RC6`, and `IDEA`. 
Popular stream ciphers include `RC4`, `ORYX`, and `SEAL`.

### Asymmetric Cryptography
Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie first described asymmetric cryptography in their 1976 paper.

asymmetric key cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses two keys: a public key and a private key.

You use the **public key** to encrypt data, and anyone can access the public key.

You can see them included in email signatures or posted on servers that exist specifically to host public keys.

**Private keys**, used to decrypt messages, are carefully guarded by the receiver.

Cryptographers use complex mathematical operations to create the private and public keys. 
These operations—which typically involve [factorizing](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=factorizing&op=translate) (التحليل إلى عوامل) very large prime numbers

**==No method exists to discover the private key by using the public key==**.

The main advantage of asymmetric key cryptography over symmetric key cryptography is that you no longer need to distribute the key.
With asymmetric key cryptography, you don’t have to share a secret key. 
You simply make your public key available, and anyone who needs to send you an encrypted message can use it without compromising the security of the system.

### Asymmetric Key Algorithms
The `RSA` algorithm, named after the initials of its creators, `Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir`.
Is an asymmetric algorithm used across the world, including in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. 
Protocols are the rules that define communication between devices. 
SSL secures many common transactions, such as web and email traffic.

[Elliptic](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=Elliptic&op=translate) curve cryptography (ECC) is a class of cryptographic algorithms, although people sometimes refer to it as though it were a single algorithm.
ECC can ==use short keys== while maintaining a ==higher cryptographic strength== than many other types of algorithms.
It’s also a ==fast== and ==efficient== type of algorithm that allows us to easily implement it on hardware that has ==less processing power== and ==memory==, such as a cell phone or portable device.
A variety of cryptographic algorithms, including the Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (`SHA-2`) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (`ECDSA`), use ECC.

Other asymmetric algorithms include `ElGamal`, `Diffie–Hellman`, and `Digital Signature Standard (DSS)`.

Many protocols and applications are based on asymmetric cryptography, including Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) for securing messages and files, SSL and Transport Layer Security (TLS) for common internet traffic, and some voice over IP (VoIP) protocols for voice conversations.


## Hash Functions
Hash functions represent a third type of modern cryptography, which we call ==**keyless**== cryptography. 
Instead of using a key, hash functions, or message digests, convert the plaintext into a largely unique and fixed-length value, You can think of these hash values as ==**fingerprints**==.

On Ubuntu you can use the built‐in command **`md5sum`** to generate an `MD5` hash.
```shell
md5sum filename.txt
echo -n "your string here" | md5sum
```
