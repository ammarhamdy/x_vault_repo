## Physical Layer Standards:
+ The services and protocols in the TCP/IP suite are defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
+ The physical layer hardware, media, encoding, and signaling standards are defined and governed by these standards organizations:
+ International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
+ Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industries Association (TIA/EIA).
+ International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
+ American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
+ Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
+ National telecommunications regulatory authorities including the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) in the USA and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).

## Physical Components:
+ The physical layer standards address three functional areas:
	+ Physical Components.
	+ Encoding.
	+ Signaling.
+ The physical components are the electronic hardware devices, media, and other connectors that transmit the signals that represent the bits.
+ Hardware components such as NICs, interfaces and connectors, cable materials.


## Encoding:
+ Encoding or line encoding is a method of ==**converting a stream of data bits into a predefined "code”.**==
+ Codes are groupings of bits used to provide a predictable pattern that can be recognized by both the sender and the receiver.
+ In other words, encoding is the method or pattern used to represent digital information.


## Signaling:
+ The physical layer must generate the electrical, optical, or wireless signals that represent the "1" and "0" on the media.
+ The way that bits are represented is called the signaling method.
+ The physical layer standards must define what type of signal represents a "1" and what type of signal represents a "0".
+ For example, a long pulse might represent a 1 whereas a short pulse might represent a 0.

## Bandwidth:
+ Different physical media support the transfer of bits at different rates.
+ Bandwidth is the capacity at which a medium can carry data.
+ ==**Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time.**==
+ Bandwidth is typically measured in:
	+ kilo-bits per second (kbps). 
	+ Megabits per second (Mbps).
	+ Gigabits per second (Gbps).
+ commonly used units of measure for bandwidth:
	+ Bits per second (bps):
		+ 1 bps = fundamental unit of bandwidth.
	+ Kilobits per second (Kbpd):
		+ 1 Kbps = 1,000 bps = 10\^3 bps.
	+ Megabits per second (Mbps):
		+ 1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bps = 10\^6 bps.
	+ Gigabits per second (Gbps):
		+ 1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bps = 10\^9 bps.
	+ Terabits per second (Tbps):
		+ 1 Tbps = 1,000,000,000,000 bps = 10\^12 bps.


## Bandwidth Terminology:
+ Terms used to ==measure the quality== of bandwidth include:
	+ Latency.
	+ Throughput.
	+ Goodput.


## Latency:
+ Latency refers to the `amount of time`, ==including delays==, for data to travel from one given point to another.
+ Latency => `amount of time`.
+ More latency is bad.
+ What is it takes to send and receive the data back?


## Throughput:
+ Throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time.
+ Throughput => `amount of bits per second`
+ More throughput is better.
+ How much bits have been transfer over 1 second?
+ factors that influence throughput:
	+ The amount of traffic.
	+ The type of traffic.
	+ The latency created by the number of network devices encountered (مواجهة) between source and destination.


## Goodput:
+ Goodput is the measure of `usable` data transferred over a given period of time.
+ Goodput is throughput minus traffic overhead for establishing (تأسيس) sessions, acknowledgments, encapsulation, and re-transmitted bits.
+ Goodput is always lower than throughput, which is generally lower than the bandwidth.
