## Properties of UTP Cabling:
+ UTP cable does not use shielding to counter the effects of EMI and RFI. 
+ Instead, cable designers have discovered other ways that they can limit the negative effect of crosstalk:
	+ **Cancellation**.
	+ **Varying (متفاوتة) the number of twists per wire pair**.


## Cancellation:
+ When two wires in an electrical circuit are placed close together, their magnetic fields are the exact opposite of each other. 
+ Therefore, the two magnetic fields cancel each other and also cancel out any outside EMI and RFI signals.


## Number of twists (عدد اللفات):
+ Each colored pair is twisted a different number of times.
+ To further enhance the cancellation effect of paired circuit wires designers vary the number of twists of each wire pair in a cable.
+ UTP cable must follow precise specifications governing how many twists or braids are permitted (مسموح به) per meter (3.28 feet) of cable.

## Standards TIA/EIA-568:
+ UTP cabling conforms to the standards established jointly by the TIA/EIA.
+ TIA/EIA-568 stipulates (ينص) the commercial cabling standards for LAN installations and is the standard most commonly used in LAN cabling environments.
+ The elements defined are:
	+ Cable types.
	+ Cable lengths.
	+ Connectors.
	+ Cable termination.
	+ Methods of testing cable.


## characteristics of copper:
+ The electrical characteristics of copper cabling are defined by the Institute (معهد) of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
+ IEEE rates UTP cabling according to its performance.
+ Cables are placed into categories based on their ability to carry higher bandwidth rates.
+ Category 5 cable is used commonly in 100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet installations.
+ Other categories include Enhanced Category 5 cable, Category 6, and Category 6a.
+ Cables in higher categories are designed and constructed to support higher data rates.


## Categories of UTP cable:
+ Category 3 was originally used for voice communication over voice lines, but later used for data transmission.
+ Category 5 and 5e is used for data transmission.
+ Category 5 supports 100Mbps and Category 5e supports 1000 Mbps
+ Category 6 has an added separator between each wire pair to support higher speeds.
+ Category 6 supports up to 10 Gbps.
+ Category 7 also supports 10 Gbps.
+ Category 8 supports 40 Gbps.

## Straight-through and Crossover UTP Cables:
+ Different situations may require UTP cables to be wired according to different wiring conventions (الاتفاقيات). 
+ This means that the individual wires in the cable have to be connected in different orders to different sets of pins in the RJ-45 connectors.
+ The main cable types that are obtained by using specific wiring conventions:
	+ **Ethernet Straight-through**.
	+ **Ethernet Crossover**.
	+ **rollover cable**.


## Ethernet Straight-through:
+ The most common type of networking cable.
+ It is commonly used to interconnect a host to a switch and a switch to a router.


## Ethernet Crossover:
+ A cable used to interconnect similar devices.
+ To connect a switch to a switch, a host to a host, or a router to a router.


## Rollover cable:
+ Another type of cable is a rollover cable, which is Cisco proprietary.
+ It is used to connect a workstation to a router or switch console port.


## No damage:
+ Using a crossover or straight-through cable incorrectly between devices may not damage the devices, but connectivity and communication between the devices will not take place.

## Cable Types and Standards:
Cable Type | Standard | Application
 :- | :- | :- 
Ethernet Straight-through | Both ends T568A or both ends T568B | Connects a network host to a network device such as a switch or hub
Ethernet Crossover | One end T568A, other end T568B | Connects two network hosts Connects two network intermediary devices (switch to switch or router to router)
Rollover | Cisco proprietary | Connects a workstation serial port to a router console port, using an adapter
