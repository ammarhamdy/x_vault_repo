## Characteristics of Copper Cabling:
+ Copper cabling is the most common type of cabling used in networks today.
+ There are three different types of copper cabling that are each used in specific situations.
+ Networks use copper media because it is inexpensive, easy to install, and has low resistance to electrical current.
+ Copper media is limited by distance and signal interference.
+ Data is transmitted on copper cables as electrical pulses.
+ The farther the signal travels, the more it deteriorates(يتدهور).
+ For this reason, all copper media must follow strict distance limitations as specified by the guiding standards.


## Effect on copper cabling:
+ The timing and voltage values of the electrical pulses are also susceptible to interference from two sources:
	+ EMI and RFI signals.
	+ Crosstalk (الحديث المتبادل).


## EMI and RFI signals:
+ **Electromagnetic interference (EMI).**
+ **Radio frequency interference (RFI)**.
+ EMI and RFI signals can distort and corrupt the data signals being carried by copper media.


## Crosstalk:
+ Crosstalk is a disturbance caused by the electric or magnetic fields of a signal on one wire to the signal in an adjacent wire.
+ In telephone circuits, crosstalk can result in hearing part of another voice conversation from an adjacent circuit.


## Types of Copper Cabling:
+ Shielded Twisted-Pair (STP) Cable.
+ Unshielded Twisted-Pair (STP) Cable.
+ Coaxial Cable.

## Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP):
+ Is the most common networking media.
+ UTP cabling, terminated with RJ-45 connectors.
+ Is used for interconnecting network hosts with intermediary networking devices, such as switches and routers.
+ In LANs, UTP cable consists of **four** pairs of color-coded wires that have been twisted together and then encased in a flexible plastic sheath that protects from minor physical damage.
+ The twisting (التواء) of wires helps protect against signal interference from other wires.

+ The key features of each number:
	1. Outer Jacket (الغلاف الخارجي) to protects the copper wires from physical damage.
	2. Twisted pairs (أزواج ملتوية) protect the signal from interfaces.
	3. Color-coded plastics insulation electrically isolates wires from each other and identifies each pair. 


## Shielded twisted-pair (STP):
+ Provides better noise protection than UTP cabling.
+ compared to UTP cable, STP cable is significantly more expensive and difficult to install.
+ Like UTP cable, STP uses an RJ-45 connector.
+ Is used for interconnecting network hosts with intermediary networking devices, such as switches and routers.
+ STP cables combine the techniques of shielding to counter EMI and RFI, and wire twisting to counter crosstalk.

+ The key features of each number:
	1. Outer Jacket (الغلاف الخارجي).
	2. Braided or foil (رقائق) shield.
	3. Foil shields (دروع من رقائق معدنية).
	4. Twisted pairs (أزواج ملتوية).


## Coaxial cable:
+ Gets its name from the fact that there are two conductors that share the same axis.
+ Coaxial cable consists of the following:
	+ A copper conductor is used to transmit the electronic signals.
	+ A layer of flexible plastic insulation surrounds a copper conductor.
		+ The insulating(عازلة) material is surrounded in a woven (منسوج) copper braid (ضفيرة), or metallic foil, that acts as the second wire in the circuit and as a shield for the inner conductor. This second layer, or shield, also reduces the amount of outside electromagnetic interference.
	+ The entire cable is covered with a cable jacket to prevent minor physical damage.

+ The key features of each number:
	1. Outer Jacket (الغلاف الخارجي).
	2. Braided copper shield (درع نحاسي مضفر).
	3. Plastic insulation (عزل بلاستيك).
	4. Copper conductor (موصل نحاسى).
