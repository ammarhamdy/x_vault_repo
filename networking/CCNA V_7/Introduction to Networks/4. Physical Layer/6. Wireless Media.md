## Properties of Wireless Media:
+ Wireless media carry electromagnetic signals that represent the binary digits of data communications using radio or microwave frequencies.
+ Wireless media provide the greatest mobility (إمكانية التنقل) options of all media.


## limitations of wireless:
+ **Coverage area**:
	+ Certain construction materials used in buildings and structures, and the local terrain (تضاريس), will limit the effective coverage.
+ **Interference**:
	+  Wireless is susceptible (مُعَرَّض ل) to interference(التشوش).
	+ Can be disrupted by such common devices as household cordless phones, some types of fluorescent lights, microwave ovens.
+ **Security**:
	+ Network security is a major component of wireless network administration.
+ **Shared medium**:
	+ WLANs operate in half-duplex, which means only one device can send or receive at a time.


## Types of Wireless Media:
+ **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)**.
+ **Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15)**.
+ **WiMAX (IEEE 802:16)**.
+ **Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)**.


## Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11).
+ Wireless LAN (WLAN) technology, commonly referred to as Wi-Fi.
+ WLAN uses a contention-based protocol known as carrier (الناقل) sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA).
+ The wireless NIC must first listen before transmitting to determine if the radio channel is clear.
+ If another wireless device is transmitting, then the NIC must wait until the channel is clear.


## Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15):
+ This is a wireless personal area network (WPAN) standard, commonly known as “Bluetooth”.
+ It uses a device pairing process to communicate over distances from 1 to 100 meters.


## WiMAX (IEEE 802:16):
+ Commonly known as Worldwide Interoperability (التوافقية) for Microware Access (WiMAX).
+ This wireless standard uses a point-to-multipoint topology to provide wireless broadband access.


## Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4):
+ Zigbee is a specification used for low-data rate, low-power communications.
+ It is intended for applications that require short-range, low data-rates and long battery life.
+ Zigbee is typically used for industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) environments such as wireless light switches and medical device data collection.


## Wireless LAN devices:
+ A common wireless data implementation is enabling devices to connect wirelessly via a LAN.
+ WLAN requires the following network devices:
	+ **Wireless Access Point (AP)**.
	+ **Wireless NIC adapters**.


## Wireless Access Point (AP):
+ These concentrate (يركز) the wireless signals from users and connect to the existing copper-based network infrastructure, such as Ethernet.
+ Home and small business wireless routers integrate the functions of a router, switch, and access point into one device (Access Point device).

## Wireless NIC adapters:
+ These provide wireless communication capability to network hosts.

## SSID:
+ SSID stands for “Service Set Identifier”. 
+ Under the IEEE 802.11 wireless networking standard, a “service set” refers to a a collection of wireless networking devices with the same parameters. 
+ So, the SSID is the identifier (name) that tells you which service set (or network) to join.


## The physical layer:
+ The physical layer is responsible for transmitting the actual signals across the physical media as bits.
+ Exchanging frames, controlling media access, and performing error detection are all functions of the data link layer.
