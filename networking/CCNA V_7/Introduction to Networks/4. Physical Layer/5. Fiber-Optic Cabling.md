## Properties of Fiber-Optic Cabling:
+ fiber-optic cabling is the other type of cabling used in networks.
+ Because it is expensive, it is not as commonly used at the various types of copper cabling.
+ Optical fiber cable transmits data over longer distances and at higher bandwidths than any other networking media.
+ fiber-optic cable can transmit signals with less attenuation (تخفيف).
+  Completely immune (منيع) to EMI and RFI.
+ Optical fiber is commonly used to interconnect network devices.
+ Optical fiber is a flexible, but extremely thin, transparent strand of very pure glass

## Data encoded in fiber:
+ Bits are encoded on the fiber as light impulses.
+ The fiber-optic cable acts as a waveguide, or “light pipe,”.


## Types of Fiber Media:
+ Single-mode fiber (SMF).
+ Multimode fiber (MMF).


## Single-mode fiber:
+ SMF consists of a very small core and uses expensive laser technology to send a single ray of light.
+ SMF is popular in long-distance situations spanning hundreds of kilometers.

## Multimode Fiber:
+ MMF consists of a larger core and uses LED emitters (بواعث) to send light pulses.
+ Light from an LED enters the multimode fiber at different angles, as shown in the figure.
+ MMFs are popular in LANs because they can be powered by low-cost LEDs.
+ It provides bandwidth up to 10 Gbps over link lengths of up to 550 meters.

## Dispersion (تشتت):
+ One of the highlighted differences between MMF and SMF is the amount of dispersion.
+ Dispersion refers to the spreading out of a light pulse over time.
+ Increased **dispersion** means increased **loss** of signal strength.
+ MMF has a greater dispersion than SMF.
+ That is why MMF can only travel up to 500 meters before signal loss.


## Fiber-Optic Cabling Usage:
+ **Enterprise Networks**.
+ **Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH)**.
+ **Long-Haul Networks**.
+ **Submarine (غواصة) Cable Networks**.


## Fiber-Optic Connectors:
+ The main differences among the types of connectors are dimensions and methods of coupling.
+ Businesses decide on the types of connectors that will be used, based on their equipment.
+ Some switches and routers have ports that support fiber-optic connectors through a small form-factor pluggable (SFP) transceiver.

## Fiber Patch Cords (كابلات التصحيح):
+ The use of color distinguishes between single-mode and multimode patch cords.
+ A yellow jacket is for single-mode fiber cables and orange (or aqua) for multimode fiber cables.
