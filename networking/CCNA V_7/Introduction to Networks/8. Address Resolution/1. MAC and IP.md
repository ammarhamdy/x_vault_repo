# Destination on Same Network


## Two primary addresses:
+ There are two primary addresses assigned to a device on an Ethernet LAN:
	+ Physical address (the MAC address). 
	+ Logical address (the IP address).

### Physical address:
+ The MAC address.
+ Used for network interface card (NIC) to NIC communications on the same Ethernet network.
+ It is a layer 2 physical addresses (Ethernet MAC addresses) are used to deliver the data link frame with the encapsulated IP packet from one NIC to another NIC that is on the same network.


### Logical address:
+ The IP address.
+ Used to send the packet from the source device to the destination device. 
+ The destination IP address may be on the same IP network as the source or it may be on a remote network.

# Destination on Remote Network


## Default gateway as a destination:
+ When the destination IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) is on a remote network, the destination MAC address will be the address of the host default gateway (i.e., the router interface).

+ Note that the Destination ip never change throw the whole travel.


## How does the packet know the next MAC?
+ How are the IP addresses of the IP packets in a data flow associated with the MAC addresses on each link along the path to the destination? 
	+ For IPv4 packets, this is done through a process called Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). 
	+ For IPv6 packets, the process is ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND).

# Remote and local


## MAC in local vs MAC in remote:
+ What destination MAC address would be included in a frame sent from a source device to a destination device on the same _local_ network?
	+ _The MAC address of the destination device._
+ What destination MAC address would be included in a frame sent from a source device to a destination device on a _remote_ local network?
	+ _The MAC address of the local router interface._
