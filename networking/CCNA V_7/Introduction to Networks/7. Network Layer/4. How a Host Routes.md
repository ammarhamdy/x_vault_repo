# Host Forwarding Decision


## A host can send a packet to: 
+ **Itself**:
	+ A host can ping itself by sending a packet to a special IPv4 address of `127.0.0.1` or an IPv6 address `::1`, which is referred to as the loopback interface. 
	+ Pinging the loopback interface tests the TCP/IP protocol stack on the host.
+ **Local host**:
	+ **==This is a destination host that is on the same local network as the sending host.==** 
	+ **==The source and destination hosts share the same network address.==**
+ **Remote host**: 
	+ This is a destination host on a remote network. 
	+ The source and destination hosts do not share the same network address.


## Method of determination:
+ Whether a packet is destined for a local host or a remote host is determined by the source end device.
+ The source end device determines whether the destination IP address is on the same network that the source device itself is on
+ The method of determination varies by IP version:
	+ **In IPv4**:
		+ The source device uses its own _subnet mask_ along with its own IPv4 address and the destination IPv4 address to make this determination.
	+ **In IPv6**: 
		+ The local router advertises the _local network address (prefix)_ to all devices on the network.


## What is the routing:
+ Devices that are beyond the local network segment are known as remote hosts. 
+ When a source device sends a packet to a remote destination device, then the help of routers and routing is needed.
+ Routing is the process of identifying the best path to a destination.

# Default Gateway


## What is the Default getway:
+ The default gateway is the network device (i.e., router or Layer 3 switch) that can route traffic to other networks.
+ **==The router connected to the local network segment is referred to as the default gateway.==**
+ If you use the analogy that a network is like a room, then the default gateway is like a doorway.


## A default gateway router:
+ On a network, a default gateway is usually a router with these features:
	+ It has a local IP address in the same address range as other hosts on the local network.
	+ It can accept data into the local network and forward data out of the local network.
	+ It routes traffic to other networks.

# A Host Routes to the Default Gateway


## Where is the default gateway?
+ A host routing table will typically include a default gateway.
+ **In IPv4**:
	+ the host receives the IPv4 address of the default gateway either dynamically from Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or configured manually. 
+ **In IPv6**:
	+ the router advertises (يعلن) the default gateway address or the host can be configured manually.


## Why default gatway?
+ A default route is the route or pathway your computer will take when it tries to contact a remote network.
+ Having a default gateway configured creates a default route in the routing table of the PC.

# Host Routing Tables


## Display the host routing table:
+ On a Windows host, the `route print` or `netstat -r` command can be used to display the host routing table.

## Focus on netstat -r output:
+ There is three sections related to the current TCP/IP network connections:
+ **Interface List**:
	+ Lists the Media Access Control (MAC) address and assigned interface number of every network-capable interface on the host, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth adapters.
+ **IPv4 Route Table**:
	+ Lists all known IPv4 routes, including direct connections, local network, and local default routes.
+ **IPv6 Route Table**: 
	+ Lists all known IPv6 routes, including direct connections, local network, and local default routes.
