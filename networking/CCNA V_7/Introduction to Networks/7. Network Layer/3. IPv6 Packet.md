# Old version


## Limitations of IPv4:
+ IPv4 still has three major issues:
	+ IPv4 address depletion.
	+ Lack of end-to-end connectivity.
	+ Increased network complexity.


### IPv4 address depletion:
+ IPv4 has a limited number of unique public addresses available. 
+ Although there are approximately 4 billion IPv4 addresses.


### Lack of end-to-end connectivity:
+  Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technology commonly implemented within IPv4 networks.
+ NAT provides a way for multiple devices to share a single public IPv4 address.
+ However, because the public IPv4 address is shared, the IPv4 address of an internal network host is hidden. This can be problematic for technologies that require end-to-end connectivity.


### Increased network complexity:
+ While NAT has extended the lifespan of IPv4 it was only meant as a transition mechanism to IPv6. 
+ NAT in its various implementation creates additional complexity in the network, creating latency and making troubleshooting more difficult.

# IPv6 Overview


## Advantages of IPv6:
+ THe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
+ Improvements that IPv6 provides include the following:
	+ Increased address space.
	+ Improved packet handling.
	+ Eliminates the need for NAT.


### Increased address space:
+ IPv6 addresses are based on 128-bit hierarchical addressing as opposed to IPv4 with 32 bits.


### Improved packet handling:
+ The IPv6 header has been simplified with fewer fields.


### Eliminates the need for NAT:
+ With such a large number of public IPv6 addresses, NAT between a private IPv4 address and a public IPv4 is not needed.
+ This avoids some of the NAT-induced problems experienced by applications that require end-to-end connectivity.


## Addresses on IPv4 and IPv6:
+ The 32-bit IPv4 address space provides approximately 4,294,967,296 unique addresses. 
+ IPv6 address space provides 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456, or 340 undecillion addresses.
+ IPv4 `10^9` IPv6 `10^36`.

# Packet Header Fields



## IPv4 Packet header fields:
+ the IPv4 header consists of a variable length header of 20 octets (up to 60 bytes if the Options field is used) and 12 basic header fields, not including the Options field and Padding field.

# IPv6 Packet Header


## IPv6 Packet Header fields:
+ ![[Pasted image 20230404164845.png]]
+ See [Sample IPv6 Headers in Wireshark - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adbIghSSac)


### Version field:
+ This field contains a 4-bit binary value set to 0110 that identifies this as an IP version 6 packet.


### Traffic Class field:
+ This 8-bit field is equivalent to the IPv4 Differentiated Services (DS) field.


### Flow Label field:
+ This 20-bit field suggests that all packets with the same flow label receive the same type of handling by routers.


### Payload Length field:
+ This 16-bit field indicates the length of the data portion or payload of the IPv6 packet. 
+ This does not include the length of the IPv6 header, which is a fixed 40-byte header.


### Next Header field:
+ This 8-bit field is equivalent to the IPv4 Protocol field.
+ It indicates the data payload type that the packet is carrying, enabling the network layer to pass the data to the appropriate upper-layer protocol.


### Hop Limit field:
+ This 8-bit field replaces the IPv4 TTL field. 
+ This value is decremented by a value of 1 by each router that forwards the packet. 
+ When the counter reaches 0, the packet is discarded, and an ICMPv6 Time Exceeded message is forwarded to the sending host, This indicates that the packet did not reach its destination because the hop limit was exceeded. 
+ Unlike IPv4, IPv6 does not include an IPv6 Header Checksum, because this function is performed at both the lower and upper layers. 
+ This means the checksum does not need to be recalculated by each router when it decrements the Hop Limit field, which also improves network performance.


### Source IPv6 Address field:
+ This 128-bit field identifies the IPv6 address of the sending host.


### Destination IPv6 Address field:
+ This 128-bit field identifies the IPv6 address of the receiving host.


## Extension headers field:
+ An IPv6 packet may also contain extension headers (EH), which provide optional network layer information. 
+ Extension headers are optional and are placed between the IPv6 header and the payload. EHs are used for fragmentation, security, to support mobility and more.
