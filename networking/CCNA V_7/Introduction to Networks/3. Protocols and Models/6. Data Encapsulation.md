## Encapsulation process:
+ As application data is passed down the protocol stack on its way to be transmitted across the network media, ==various protocol information is added at each level. ==
+ This is known as the encapsulation process.


## Segmenting Messages:
+ ==Segmentation is the process of dividing a stream of data into smaller units for transmissions over the network.==
+ Segmentation is necessary because data networks use the TCP/IP protocol suite send data in individual IP packets.
+ Each packet is sent separately, similar to sending a long letter as a series of individual postcards.
+ Packets containing segments for the same destination can be sent over different paths.


## Benefits from segmentation:
+ **Increases speed**:
	+ large amounts of data can be sent over the network without tying up (ربط) a communications link.
	+ This allows many different conversations (محادثات) to be interleaved (مدخل) on the network called multiplexing (مضاعفة).
+ **Increases efficiency**:
	+ If a single segment is fails to reach its destination due to a failure in the network or network congestion, only that segment needs to be retransmitted instead of resending the entire data stream.

## Sequencing:
+ In network communications, each segment of the message must go through a similar process to ensure that it gets to the correct destination and can be reassembled into the content of the original message.

## Protocol Data Units (PDU):
+ Although the PDU is called datagram, IP packets are sometimes also referred to as IP datagrams.
+ The form that a piece of data takes at any layer is called a protocol data unit (PDU).
+ Each succeeding (النجاح) layer encapsulates the PDU that it receives from the layer above in accordance (وفقا) with the protocol being used.

## Protocol Data Units (PDU) in each layer:
+ Data:
	+ the general term for the PDU used at the application layer.
+ Segment or datagram:
	+ Transport layer PDU.
	+ PDU called ==Segment== when using TCP.
	+ PDU called ==datagram== when using UDP.
+ Packet:
	+ Network layer PDU.
+ Frame:
	+ Data Link layer PDU.
+ Bits:
	+ Physical layer PDU used when physically transmitting data over the medium.
