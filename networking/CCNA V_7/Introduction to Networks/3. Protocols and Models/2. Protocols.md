## Network Protocol Overview:
+ ==Network protocols define a common format and set of rules for exchanging messages between devices.==
+ Protocols are implemented by end devices and intermediary devices in software, hardware, or both.
+ Each network protocol has its own function, format, and rules for communications.


## types of protocols that are needed:
| **Protocol type**                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Network Communications Protocols** | Protocols enable two or more devices to communicate over one or more networks. The Ethernet family of technologies involves a variety of protocols such as **`IP`**, Transmission Control Protocol (**`TCP`**), HyperText Transfer Protocol (**`HTTP`**), and many more.                                                |
| **Network Security Protocols**       | Protocols secure data to provide authentication, data integrity, and data encryption. Examples of secure protocols include Secure Shell (**`SSH`**), Secure Sockets Layer (**`SSL`**), and Transport Layer Security (**`TLS`**).                                                                                        |
| **Routing Protocols**                | Protocols enable routers to exchange route information, compare path information, and then to select the best path to the destination network. Examples of routing protocols include Open Shortest Path First (**`OSPF`**) and Border Gateway Protocol (**`BGP`**).                                                     |
| **Service Discovery Protocols**      | Protocols are used for the automatic detection of devices or services. Examples of service discovery protocols include Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (**`DHCP`**) which discovers services for IP address allocation, and Domain Name System (**`DNS`**) which is used to perform name-to-IP address translation. |
