You know the basic components of a simple network, as well as initial configuration.

But after you have configured and connected these components, how do you know they will work together?

## Protocols!

Protocols are sets of agreed (متفق) upon rules that have been created by standards organizations.
But, because you cannot pick up a rule and look closely at it, how do you truly understand why there is such a rule and what it is supposed to do?

## Models!

==Models give you a way to visualize the rules and their place in your network.==

This module gives you an overview of network protocols and models. 

You are about to have a much deeper understanding of how networks actually work!
