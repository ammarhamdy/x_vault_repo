## Communications Fundamentals:
+ For communication to occur, devices must know “**how**” to communicate.
+ All communication methods have the following three elements in common:
+ **Message source (sender)**:
	+ Message sources are people, or electronic devices, that need to send a message to other individuals or devices.
+ **Message Destination (receiver)**:
	+ The destination receives the message and interprets it.
+ **Channel**:
	+ This consists of the media that provides the pathway over which the message travels from source to destination.


## Communication Protocols:
+ Sending a message is governed (يحكم) by rules called protocols.
+ These protocols are specific to the type of communication method being used.


## Rule Establishment:
+ Protocols must account for the following requirements to successfully deliver a message that is understood by the receiver:
	+ An identified sender and receiver.
	+ Common language and grammar.
	+ Speed and timing of delivery.
	+ Confirmation or acknowledgment requirements.


## Network Protocol Requirements:
+ In addition to identifying the source and destination.
+ Computer and network ==protocols define the details of how a message is transmitted across a network.==
+ Common computer protocols include the following:
	+ Message encoding.
	+ Message formatting and encapsulation.
	+ Message size.
	+ Message timing.
	+ Message delivery options.


### Message Encoding:
+ ==Encoding is the process of converting information into another acceptable form==, for transmission.
+ Decoding reverses this process to interpret the information.
+ Encoding between hosts must be in an appropriate (ملائم) format for the medium.
+ Messages sent across the network are first converted into bits by the sending host.
+ Each bit is encoded into a pattern of voltages on copper wires, infrared light (ضوء الأشعة تحت الحمراء) in optical fibers, or microwaves for wireless systems.
+ The destination host receives and decodes the signals to interpret the message.


### Message Formatting and Encapsulation:
+ Similar to sending a letter, a message that is sent over a computer network follows specific format rules for it to be delivered and processed.
+ Message formats depend on the type of message and the channel that is used to deliver the message.


### Message Size:
+ Likewise, when a long message is sent from one host to another over a network, it is necessary to break the message into smaller pieces.
+ The size restrictions of frames require the source host to break a long message into individual pieces that meet both the minimum and maximum size requirements.


### Message Timing:
+ Message timing includes the following:
	+ **Flow Control**.
	+ **Response Timeout**.
	+ **Access method**.


#### Flow control:
+ This is the process of managing the rate of data transmission.
+ ==Flow control defines how much information can be sent and the speed at which it can be delivered (تم التوصيل).==


#### Response timeout:
+ Hosts on the network use network protocols that specify how long to wait for responses and what action to take if a response timeout occurs.


#### Access method:
+ When a device wants to transmit on a wireless LAN (WLAN), it is necessary for the WLAN network interface card (NIC) to determine whether the wireless medium is available.


### Message Delivery Options:
+ There three types of data communications include:
	+ **Uni-cast**: 
		+ Information is being transmitted to a single end device.
	+ **Multi-cast**:
		+ Information is being transmitted to a one or more end devices.
	+ **Broad-cast**: 
		+ Information is being transmitted to all end devices.
