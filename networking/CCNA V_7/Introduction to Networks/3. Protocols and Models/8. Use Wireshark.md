## Use Wireshark
![[3.7.10-lab---use-wireshark-to-view-network-traffic.pdf]]


## steps:
+ Open iwreshark start cpature data from wifi interface.
+ Get the target ip addtess `192.168.1.3`.
	+ Make sure the device still open.
	+ Maybe the target device not responding cause of the firewall disallow this.
+ On terminal type `ping 1892.168.1.3`.
+ See caputred data on wireshark.


## What is happing:
+ ICMP request, ICMP data is encapsulated inside an IPv4 packet PDU (IPv4 header) which is then encapsulated in an Ethernet II frame PDU (Ethernet II header) for transmission on the LAN.


## Important info:
+ A ping to a local host returns the MAC address of the PC NIC.
+ A ping to a remote host returns the MAC address of the default gateway LAN interface.
+ MAC addresses for remote hosts are not known on the local network, so the MAC address of the default-gateway is used:
	+ That mean when the destination is unknown the getway will be the destination because the getway will know the right destination.
+ After the packet reaches the default-gateway router, the Layer 2 information is stripped from the packet and a new Layer 2 header is attached with the destination MAC address of the next hop router.
