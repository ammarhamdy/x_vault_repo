## The Data Link Layer:
+ The OSI model (Layer 2).
+ **==Responsible for network interface card (NIC) to network interface card communications.==**
+ **==Enables upper layers to access the media.==**
+ The upper layer protocol is completely unaware of the type of media that is used to forward the data.
+ Accepts data, usually Layer 3 packets (i.e., IPv4 or IPv6), and encapsulates them into Layer 2 frames.
+ Controls how data is placed and received on the media.
+ Exchanges **frames** between endpoints over the network media.
+ Performs error detection and rejects any corrupt frame.

## Without data link layer:
+ Without the data link layer, network layer protocols such as IP, would have to make provisions for connecting to every type of media that could exist along a delivery path.
+ Additionally, every time a new network technology or medium was developed IP, would have to adapt.

## IEEE 802 LAN/MAN:
+ IEEE 802 LAN/MAN standards are specific to Ethernet LANs, wireless LANs (WLAN), wireless personal area networks (WPAN) and other.
+ The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN data link layer consists of the following two sublayers:
	+ **Logical Link Control (LLC)**.
	+ **Media Access Control (MAC)**.


## Logical Link Control (LLC):
+ This IEEE 802.2 sublayer communicates between the networking software at the upper layers and the device hardware at the lower layers.
+ It places information in the frame that identifies which network layer protocol is being used for the frame.
+ This information allows multiple Layer 3 protocols, such as IPv4 and IPv6, to use the same network interface and media.
+ Takes the network protocol data, which is typically an IPv4 or IPv6 packet, and adds Layer 2 control information to help deliver the packet to the destination node.


## Media Access Control (MAC):
+ Implements this sublayer (IEEE 802.3, 802.11, or 802.15) in hardware.
+ It is responsible for data **encapsulation** and media access control.
+ It provides data link layer addressing and it is integrated with various physical layer technologies.
+ Controls the NIC and other hardware that is responsible for sending and receiving data on the wired or wireless LAN/MAN medium.


## LLC and MAC:

## MAC sublayer data encapsulation:
+ **Frame delimiting (التحديد)**:
	+ The framing process provides important delimiters to identify fields within a frame.
	+ These delimiting bits provide synchronization between the transmitting and receiving nodes.
+ **Addressing**:
	+ Provides source and destination addressing for transporting the Layer 2 frame between devices on the same shared medium.
+ **Error detection**:
	+ Includes a trailer used to detect transmission errors.


## MAC and Half-duplex:
+ The MAC sublayer also provides media access control, allowing multiple devices to communicate over a shared (half-duplex) medium.
+ Full-duplex communications do not require access control.


## Layer 2 functions:
+ At each hop along the path, a router performs the following Layer 2 functions:
	1. Accepts a frame from a medium.
	2. De-encapsulates the frame.
	3. Re-encapsulates the packet into a new frame.
	4. Forwards the new frame appropriate to the medium of that segment of the physical network.

## Data Link Layer Standards:
+ Data link layer protocols are generally not defined by Request for Comments (RFCs).
+ Engineering organizations that define open standards and protocols that apply to the network access layer:
	+ Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
	+ International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
	+ International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
	+ American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
