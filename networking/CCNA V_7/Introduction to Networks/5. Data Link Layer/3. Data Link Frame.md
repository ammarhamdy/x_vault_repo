## The frame:
+ This topic discusses in detail what happens to the data link frame as it moves through a network.
+ **==The information appended to a frame is determined by the protocol being used.==**
+ The data link layer prepares the encapsulated data (usually an IPv4 or IPv6 packet) for transport across the local media by encapsulating it with a header and a trailer to create a frame.
+ **==The data link protocol is responsible for NIC-to-NIC communications within the same network.==**
+ Each frame type has three basic parts:
	1. Header.
	2. Data.
	3. Trailer.
+ There is no one frame structure that meets the needs of all data transportation across all types of media.


### The shape of frame depends on:
+ The environment.
+ The amount of control information needed in the frame varies to match the access control requirements of the media and logical topology.
+ For example, a WLAN frame must include procedures for collision avoidance and therefore requires additional control information when compared to an Ethernet frame.


### Frame objectives:
+ Framing breaks the stream into decipherable (قابلة للفك) groupings.
+ With control information inserted in the header and trailer as values in different fields.
+ This format gives the physical signals a structure that are by recognized by nodes and decoded into packets at the destination.


### Frame Fields:
+ Not all protocols include all these fields.
+ ![[Pasted image 20230314110548.png]]
+ ***Frame start and stop indicator flags***: 
	+ Used to identify the beginning and end limits of the frame.
+ ***Addressing***: 
	+ Indicates the source and destination nodes on the media.
+ ***Type***: 
	+ Identifies the Layer 3 protocol in the data field.
+ ***Control***: 
	+ Identifies special flow control services such as quality of service (QoS). 
	+ QoS gives forwarding priority to certain types of messages. 
	+ For example, voice over IP (VoIP) frames normally receive priority because they are sensitive to delay.
+ ***Data***: 
	+ Contains the frame payload (الحمولة) (i.e., packet header, segment header, and the data).
+ ***Error Detection***: 
	+ Included after the data to form the trailer.


### Frame trailer:
+ Data link layer protocols add a trailer to the end of each frame.
+ In a process called error detection, the trailer determines if the frame arrived without error.
+ It places a logical or mathematical summary of the bits that comprise the frame in the trailer.


### Cyclic redundancy check (CRC):
+ A transmitting node (the node that send) creates a logical summary of the contents of the frame, known as the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value.
+ This value is placed in the frame check sequence (FCS) field to represent the contents of the frame.
+ In the Ethernet trailer, the FCS provides a method for the receiving node to determine whether the frame experienced transmission errors.



## Layer 2 Addresses:
+ Device addresses at this layer are referred to as physical addresses.
+ Data link layer addressing is contained within the frame header and specifies the frame **destination** node on the **local** network.
+ It is typically at the beginning of the frame, so the NIC can quickly determine if it matches its own Layer 2 address before accepting the rest of the frame.
+ The frame header may also contain the **source** address of the frame.
+ Physical addresses do not indicate on what network the device is located.
+ The physical address is unique to the specific device.


### Frame travel:
+ The source host encapsulates the Layer 3 IP packet in a Layer 2 frame.
+ In the frame header, the host adds:
	+ Its Layer 2 address as the **source**.
	+ and The Layer 2 address for R1 as the **destination**.
+ ![[Pasted image 20230314112221.png]]
+ Addresses at this layer (layer 2) have no meaning beyond the local network.
+ Using the IP address, the router can determine the network location of the destination device and the best path to reach it.
+ When it knows where to forward the packet, the router then ***creates a new frame*** for the packet, and the new frame is sent on to the next network segment toward its final destination.


## LAN and WAN Frames:
+ Ethernet protocols are used by wired LANs.
+ Wireless communications fall under WLAN (IEEE 802.11) protocols. These protocols were designed for multiaccess networks.
+ WANs traditionally used other types of protocols for various types of point-to-point, hub-spoke, and full-mesh topologies.


### Old WAN protocols:
+ Some of the common WAN protocols over the years have included:
	+ Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).
	+ High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC).
	+ Frame Relay.
	+ Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).
	+ X.25.
+ These Layer 2 protocols are now being ***replaced*** in the WAN by Ethernet.


### behaviour of Layer 2 protocols:
+ In a TCP/IP network, all OSI Layer 2 protocols work with IP at OSI Layer 3.
+ The Layer 2 protocol used depends on the logical topology and the physical media.
+ Each protocol performs media access control (MAC) for specified Layer 2 logical topologies.
+ This means that a number of different network devices can act as nodes that operate at the data link layer when implementing these protocols.
+ These devices include the NICs on computers as well as the interfaces on routers and Layer 2 switches.


### Specify the used protocol:
+ The Layer 2 protocol that is used for a particular network topology is determined by: _the technology used to implement that topology_.
+ The technology used is determined by:
	+ the size of the network, in terms of the number of hosts. 
	+ The geographic scope.
	+ The services to be provided over the network.


### Data link layer protocols include:
+ Ethernet.
+ 802.11 Wireless.
+ Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).
+ High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC).
+ Frame Relay.
