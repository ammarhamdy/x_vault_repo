## Topology:
+ The topology of a network is the arrangement, or the relationship, of the network devices and the interconnections between them.


## Physical and Logical Topologies:
+ There are two types of topologies used when describing LAN and WAN networks:
	+ **Physical topology**.
	+ **Logical topology**.


### Physical topology:
+ Identifies the physical connections and how end devices and intermediary devices (i.e, routers, switches, and wireless access points) are interconnected.
+ The topology may also include specific device location such as room number and location on the equipment rack.
+ Physical topologies are usually point-to-point or star.


### Logical topology:
+ Refers to the way a network transfers frames from one node to the next.
+ This topology identifies virtual connections using device interfaces and Layer 3 IP addressing schemes.


## WAN Topologies:
+ Point to point topology:
	+ This is the simplest and most common WAN topology.
	+ It consists of a permanent link between two endpoints.
	+ ![[Pasted image 20230312212744.png]]
+ Hub and spoke topology:
	+ This is a WAN version of the star topology
	+ In which a central site interconnects branch sites through the use of point-to-point links.
	+ Branch sites cannot exchange data with other branch sites without going through the central site.
	+ ![[Pasted image 20230312212912.png]]
+ Mesh topology:
	+ This topology provides high availability but requires that every end system is interconnected to every other system.
	+ ![[Pasted image 20230312213004.png]]


## Point-to-Point WAN Topology:
+ Physical point-to-point topologies directly connect two nodes.
+ A node does not have to make any determination about whether an incoming frame is destined for it or another node. Therefore, the logical data link protocols can be very simple.
+ ![[Pasted image 20230314072738.png]]
+ A source and destination node may be indirectly connected to each other over some geographical distance using multiple intermediary devices.
+ However, the use of physical devices in the network does not affect the logical topology.
+ The logical point-to-point connection is the same.

## LAN Topologies:
+ In multiaccess LANs, end devices (i.e., nodes) are interconnected using star or extended star topologies.
+ ![[Pasted image 20230314073449.png]]
+ ![[Pasted image 20230314073510.png]]
+ In this type of topology, end devices are connected to a central intermediary device.


### Legacy LAN Topologies:
+ Early Ethernet and legacy Token Ring LAN technologies.
+ Included two other types of topologies:
	+ Ring.
	+ ![[Pasted image 20230314073810.png]]
	+ Bus.
	+ ![[Pasted image 20230314073828.png]]


## 3 ways:
+ The data that is transmitted over the network can flow using one of three modes:
	+ **Simplex**: Data can only flow in one direction.
	+ **Half-duplex**: Data flows in one direction at a time.
	+ **Full-duplex**: Data flows in both directions at the same time.


## Half-duplex communication:
+ Both devices can transmit and receive on the media but cannot do so simultaneously (معًا).
+ WLANs and legacy bus topologies with Ethernet hubs use the half-duplex mode.
+ Half-duplex allows only one device to send or receive at a time on the shared medium.


## Full-duplex communication:
+ Both devices can simultaneously transmit and receive on the shared media.
+ The data link layer assumes that the media is available for transmission for both nodes at any time.
+ Ethernet switches operate in full-duplex mode by default, but they can operate in half-duplex if connecting to a device such as an Ethernet hub.

## Media access Control Methods:
+ Ethernet LANs and WLANs are examples of multiaccess networks.
+ A multiaccess network is a network that can have two or more end devices attempting to access the network simultaneously.
+ There are two basic access control methods for shared media:
	+ Contention (تنازع) -based access:
		+ CSMA/CD:
			+ Carrier sense multiple access with collision ***detection***.
		+ CSMA/CA:
			+ Carrier sense multiple access with collision ***avoidance***.
	+ Controlled access.


### Contention(تنازع)-based access:
+ In contention-based multiaccess networks, all nodes are operating in half-duplex, competing for (تتنافس على) the use of the medium.
+ There is a process if more than one device transmits at the same time:
	+ Carrier (الناقل) sense multiple access with collision ***detection*** (CSMA/CD) used on legacy bus-topology Ethernet LANs.
	+ Carrier sense multiple access with collision ***avoidance*** (CSMA/CA) used on Wireless LANs.


### Controlled access:
+ In a controlled-based multiaccess network, each node has its own time to use the medium.
+ These deterministic types of legacy networks are inefficient because a device must wait its turn to access the medium.


### CSMA/CD:
+ Examples of contention-based access networks include the following (These networks operate in half-duplex mode):
	+ Wireless LAN (uses CSMA/CA).
	+ Legacy bus-topology Ethernet LAN (uses CSMA/CD).
	+ Legacy Ethernet LAN using a hub (uses CSMA/CD).


### Collision detection (CD):
+ If two devices transmit at the same time, a collision will occur.
+ For legacy Ethernet LANs, both devices will detect the collision on the network. This is the collision detection (CD) portion of CSMA/CD.
+ The NIC compares data transmitted with data received, or by recognizing that the signal amplitude is higher than normal on the media.
+ The data sent by both devices will be corrupted and will need to be resent.


## Etherent Hub:
+ An Ethernet hub is also known as a multiport repeater. Any bits received on an incoming port are regenerated and sent out all other ports, as shown in the figure.


## CSMA used by IEEE 802.11:
+ Another form of CSMA used by IEEE 802.11 WLANs is carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA).
+ CMSA/CA uses a method similar to CSMA/CD to detect if the media is clear.
+ CMSA/CA uses additional techniques.
+ In wireless environments it may not be possible for a device to detect a collision.
+ CMSA/CA does not detect collisions but attempts to avoid them by waiting before transmitting.
+ Each device that transmits includes the time duration that it needs for the transmission.
+ All other wireless devices receive this information and know how long the medium will be unavailable.
+ ![[Pasted image 20230314084233.png]]
+ After a wireless device sends an 802.11 frame, the receiver returns an acknowledgment so that the sender knows the frame arrived.


## Switch not need CSMA/CD:
+ Ethernet LANs using switches do not use a contention-based system because the switch and the host NIC operate in full-duplex mode.
