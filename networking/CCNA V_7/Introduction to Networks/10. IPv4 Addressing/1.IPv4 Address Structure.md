## Network and Host Portions

An IPv4 address is a 32-bit hierarchical address that is made up of a network portion and a host portion. 

When determining the network portion versus the host portion, you must look at the 32-bit stream, as shown in the figure.

The bits within the network portion of the address must be identical for all devices that reside in the same network. 

The bits within the host portion of the address must be unique to identify a specific host within a network.

But how do hosts know which portion of the 32-bits identifies the network and which identifies the host? That is the role of the **==subnet mask==**.

## The Subnet Mask


As shown in the figure, assigning an IPv4 address to a host requires the following:
- **IPv4 address** - This is the unique IPv4 address of the host.
- **Subnet mask**- This is used to identify the network/host portion of the IPv4 address.

**Note:** A default gateway IPv4 address is required to reach remote networks and DNS server IPv4 addresses are required to translate domain names to IPv4 addresses

**==The actual process used to identify the network portion and host portion is called `AND==**ing`.

## The Prefix Length

Expressing network addresses and host addresses with the dotted decimal subnet mask address can become cumbersome.

Fortunately, there is an alternative method of identifying a subnet mask, a method called the prefix length.

The prefix length is the number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask. It is written in “slash notation”, which is noted by a forward slash (/) followed by the number of bits set to 1.

Count the number of bits in the subnet mask and prepend it with a slash.

### Comparing the Subnet Mask and Prefix Length
|**Subnet Mask**|**32-bit Address**|**Prefix Length**|
|---|---|---|
|255.0.0.0|11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000|/8|
|255.255.0.0|11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000|/16|
|255.255.255.0|11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000|/24|
|255.255.255.128|11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000|/25|
|255.255.255.192|11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000|/26|
|255.255.255.224|11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000|/27|
|255.255.255.240|11111111.11111111.11111111.11110000|/28|
|255.255.255.248|11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000|/29|
|255.255.255.252|11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100|/30|
The first column lists various subnet masks that can be used with a host address. 
The second column displays the converted 32-bit binary address. 
The last column displays the resulting prefix length.

When representing an IPv4 address using a prefix length, the IPv4 address is written followed by the prefix length with no spaces.
`192.168.10.10 255.255.255.0` would be written as `192.168.10.10/24`.

# Forms of IP Address

there are several valid forms that IP addresses can take, especially when input into various software or interpreted programmatically.

Here are the **possible forms** for an IP address like `127.0.0.1`:

## 1. **Dotted Decimal Notation (Standard Format)**
- **Example**: `127.0.0.1`
- This is the most common human-readable format.
- Each octet is a decimal number (0–255), separated by dots.

## 2. **Decimal Format (Single Integer Representation)**
- **Example**: `2130706433`
- This is the 32-bit integer representation of the IP.
- Formula:
```python
127*256**3 + 0*256**2+0*256**1+1×256**0=2130706433
```
- Some systems (like certain versions of `ping` on Linux) may accept this format.

## 3. **Hexadecimal Notation**
- **Full hexadecimal (with `0x`)**:
    - Example: `0x7F000001`
    - 127 = `0x7F`, so `127.0.0.1` = `0x7F000001`
- **Per-octet hex**:
    - Example: `0x7f.0x0.0x0.0x1`
    - Each octet is represented in hex, separated by dots.

## 4. **Octal Notation**
- **Example**: `0177.0.0.01`
- Each octet is written in base-8 (preceded by a `0`).
- `127` = `0177` in octal, `1` = `01`, etc.

## 5. **Mixed Notations**

- Some systems (e.g., old Unix-based or C-based systems) allow mixing forms:
    - `127.1` (interpreted as `127.0.0.1`)
    - `127.0.1` (interpreted as `127.0.0.1`)
    - `127.0.0.1`, `2130706433`, and `0x7F000001` all represent the same IP.

## 6. **IPv6 Format (Loopback Equivalent)**
- IPv6 version of `127.0.0.1` is:
    - `::1`
- Notation is very different but functionally equivalent (loopback address).

## 7. **URL-Encoded or Obscured Variants**
- In some old browsers or malware tricks:
    - IPs can be obscured like:
        - `http://2130706433/`
        - `http://0x7F000001/`
        - `http://0177.0.0.01/`
