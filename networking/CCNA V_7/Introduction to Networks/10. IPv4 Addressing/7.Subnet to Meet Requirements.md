## Subnet Private versus Public IPv4 Address Space

While it is nice to quickly segment a network into subnets, your organization’s network may use both public and private IPv4 addresses. 
This affects how you will subnet your network.

The figure shows a typical enterprise network:
- **Intranet -** This is the **==internal==** part of a company’s network, accessible only within the organization. Devices in the intranet use private IPv4 addresses.
- **DMZ -** This is part of the company’s network containing resources available to the internet such as a web server. Devices in the DMZ use public IPv4 addresses.

Both the intranet and the DMZ have their own subnetting requirements and challenges.

The intranet uses private IPv4 addressing space. 
This allows an organization to use any of the private IPv4 network addresses including the 10.0.0.0/8 prefix with 24 host bits and over 16 million hosts. 
Using a network address with 24 host bits makes subnetting easier and more flexible. 
This includes subnetting on an octet boundary using a /16 or /24.


**What about the DMZ?**
Because these devices need to be publicly accessible from the internet, the devices in the DMZ require public IPv4 addresses. 
The depletion of public IPv4 address space became an issue beginning in the mid-1990s. Since 2011, IANA and four out of five RIRs have run out of IPv4 address space. 
Although organizations are making the transition to IPv6, the remaining IPv4 address space remains severely limited. 
This means an organization must maximize its own limited number of public IPv4 addresses. This requires the network administrator to subnet their public address space into subnets with different subnet masks, in order to minimize the number of unused host addresses per subnet. 
This is known as Variable Subnet Length Masking (VLSM).
