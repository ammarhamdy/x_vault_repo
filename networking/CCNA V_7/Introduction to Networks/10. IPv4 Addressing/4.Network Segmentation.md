Switches propagate broadcasts out all interfaces except the interface on which it was received. 
For example, if a switch in the figure were to receive a broadcast, it would forward it to the other switches and other users connected in the network.

A router, R1, is connected to a switch via interface G0/0. The switch has connections to three other switches. 
The broadcast domain consists of the four switches and the router interface to which they are connected. 
A connection from the router to the Internet is not within the broadcast domain.

## Problems with Large Broadcast Domains


LAN 1 connects 400 users that could generate an excess amount of broadcast traffic. 
![[Pasted image 20250118182209.png]]
This results in slow network operations due to the significant amount of traffic it can cause, and slow device operations because a device must accept and process each broadcast packet.

In the figure, the 400 users in LAN 1 with network address `172.16.0.0 /16` have been divided into two subnets of 200 users each: `172.16.0.0 /24` and `172.16.1.0 /24`. 
Broadcasts are only propagated within the smaller broadcast domains. Therefore, a broadcast in LAN 1 would not propagate to LAN 2.

## Reasons for Segmenting Networks

Subnetting reduces overall network traffic and improves network performance.

It also enables an administrator to implement security policies such as which subnets are allowed or not allowed to communicate together. 

Another reason is that it reduces the number of devices affected by abnormal broadcast traffic due to misconfigurations, hardware/software problems, or malicious intent.
