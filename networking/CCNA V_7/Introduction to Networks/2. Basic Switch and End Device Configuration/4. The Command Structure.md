## Structure of commands:
+ the basic structure of commands for the Cisco IOS.

## IOS Command Syntax Check:
+ A command might require one or more arguments.
+ To determine the keywords and arguments required for a command, refer to the command syntax.
+ The syntax provides the pattern, or format, that must be used when entering a command.

| **Convention** (الاتفاقيات) | **Description**                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bold**                    | Bold text indicates commands and keywords that you enter literally as shown.                                                                                       |
| _italics_                   | Italic text indicates arguments for which you supply values.                                                                                                       |
| \[x\]                       | square brackets indicate an ==optional element== (keyword or argument).                                                                                            |
| \{x\}                       | Braces indicate a ==required element== (keyword or argument).                                                                                                      |
| \[x {y \| z}\]              | Braces and vertical lines within square brackets indicate a required choice within an optional element. Spaces are used to clearly delineate parts of the command. |


## Examples demonstrate conventions:
+ **ping** _ip-address_ :
	+ The command is **ping**.
	+ The user-defined argument is the _ip-address_ of the destination device.
	+ `ping 10.10.10.5`
+ **traceroute** _ip-address_ :
	+ The command is **traceroute**.
	+ The user-defined argument is the _ip-address_ of the destination device.
	+ `traceroute 192.168.254.254`


## IOS Help Features:
+ The IOS has two forms of help available:
	+ Context(سياق)-sensitive help.
	+ Command syntax check.


## Context-sensitive help:
+ To access context-sensitive help, simply enter a question mark, **`?`**, at the CLI.
+ Context-sensitive help enables you to quickly find answers to these questions:
	+ Which commands are available in each command mode?
	+ Which commands start with specific characters or group of characters?
	+ Which arguments and keywords are available to particular commands?


## Command syntax check:
+ Command syntax check verifies that a valid command was entered by the user.
+ When a command is entered, the command line interpreter evaluates the command from left to right.
+ If the interpreter understands the command, the requested action is executed.
+ If the interpreter cannot understand the command being entered, it will provide feedback describing what is wrong with the command.


## Hot Keys and Shortcuts:
+ The **configure** command can be shortened to **conf** because **configure** is the only command that begins with **conf**.
