## Configuration Files:
+ There are two system files that store the device configuration:
	+ **startup-config**.
	+ **running-config**.


## Startup-config file:
+ This is the saved configuration file that is stored in NVRAM.
+ It contains all the commands that will be ==used by the device upon startup or reboot.==
+ Flash does not lose its contents when the device is powered off.


## Running-config file:
+ This is stored in Random Access Memory (RAM).
+ ==It reflects the current configuration.==
+ Modifying a running configuration affects the operation of a Cisco device immediately.
+ RAM is volatile memory. 
+ It loses all of its content when the device is powered off or restarted.


## Show startup-config:
+ the **`show startup-config`** privileged EXEC command is used to show startup config.
+ If power to the device is lost, or if the device is restarted, all configuration changes will be lost unless they have been saved.
+ To save changes made to the running configuration to the startup configuration file use the `copy running-config startup-config` privileged EXEC mode command.


## Show running-config:
+ The **`show running-config`** privileged EXEC mode command is used to view the running config.
+ The command will list the complete configuration currently stored in RAM.


## Alter the Running Configuration:
+ To alter (تغيير) the Running Configuration remove the changed commands individually (one by one).
+ Or reload the device using the **`reload`** privileged EXEC mode command to restore the startup-config.
+ The downside to using the `reload` command to remove an unsaved running config is the brief amount of time the device will be offline, causing network downtime.
+ The startup config is removed by using the `erase startup-config` privileged EXEC mode command.
+ After removing the startup config from NVRAM, reload the device to remove the current running config file from RAM.


## Capture Configuration to a Text File:
+ Configuration files can also be saved and archived to a text document.
+ **Step 1.** Open terminal emulation software, such as PuTTY or Tera Term, that is already connected to a switch.

+ **Step 2.** Enable logging in the terminal software and assign a name and file location to save the log file.

+ **Step 3.** Execute the `show running-config` or `show startup-config` command at the privileged EXEC prompt.
+ Text displayed in the terminal window will be placed into the chosen file.
+ **Step 4.** Disable logging in the terminal software.

+ To restore a configuration file to a device:	
	+ **Step 1.** Enter global configuration mode on the device.
	+ **Step 2.** Copy and paste the text file into the terminal window connected to the switch.
