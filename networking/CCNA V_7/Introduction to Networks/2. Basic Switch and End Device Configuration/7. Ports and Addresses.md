## IP Addresses:
+ The use of IP addresses is the primary means of enabling devices to locate one another and establish end-to-end communication on the internet.
+ Each end device on a network must be configured with an IP address.
+ Examples of end devices include these:
	+ Computers (work stations, laptops, file servers, web servers).
	+ Network printers.
	+ VoIP phones.
	+ Security cameras.
	+ Smart phones.
	+ Mobile handheld devices (such as wireless barcode scanners).


## IPV4:
+ The structure of an IPv4 address is called dotted decimal notation and is represented by four decimal numbers between 0 and 255.
+ IPv4 addresses are assigned to individual devices connected to a network.
+ IPv6 is the most recent version of IP and is replacing the more common IPv4.
+ ==**The subnet mask determines to which subnet the device is a member.**==
+ An IPv4 subnet mask is a 32-bit value that differentiates the network portion of the address from the host portion.


## IPV6:
+ IPv6 addresses are ==**128**== bits in length and written as a string of hexadecimal values.
+ ==**Every four bits is represented by a single hexadecimal digit.**==
+ For a total of 32 hexadecimal values.
+ Groups of four hexadecimal digits are separated by a colon (`:`) .
+ IPv6 addresses are not case-sensitive and can be written in either lowercase or uppercase.


## Interfaces and Ports:
+ Network communications depend on end user device interfaces, networking device interfaces, and the cables that connect them.
+ Each physical interface has specifications, or standards, that define it.
+ A cable connecting to the interface must be designed to match the physical standards of the interface.


## Types of network media include:
+ Twisted-pair copper cables.

+ Fiber-optic cables.

+ Coaxial cables.
	+ ![[Pasted image 20230211182922.png]]
+ Wireless.


## Ethernet:
+ Is a technology used for wired local area network (LANs).
+ It defines as set of standards for physical component.  
+ Ethernet is the most common local-area network (LAN) technology used today.
+ Ethernet ports are found on end-user devices, switch devices, and other networking devices that can physically connect to the network using a cable.

## virtual interface (VI):
+ The virtual interface lets you remotely manage a switch over a network using IPv4 and IPv6.
+ Each switch comes with one SVI appearing in the default configuration "out-of-the-box." The default SVI is interface VLAN1.
+ Each switch comes with one ==switch virtual interface (SVI)== appearing in the default configuration "out-of-the-box." ==**The default SVI is interface VLAN1.**==


## Switch and IP address:
+ A Layer 2 switch does not need an IP address.
+ ==The IP address assigned to the switch virtual interface (SVI) is used to remotely access the switch.==
+ ==An IP address is not necessary for the switch to perform its operations.==
