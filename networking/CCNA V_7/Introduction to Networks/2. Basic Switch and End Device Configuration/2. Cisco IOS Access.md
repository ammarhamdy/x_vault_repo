## Operating Systems:
+ All end devices and network devices require an operating system (OS).
+ The portion (جزء) of the OS that interacts directly with computer hardware is known as the **kernel**.
+ The portion that interfaces with applications and the user is known as the **shell**.
+ The user can interact with the shell using a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Shell:
+ The user interface that allows users to request specific tasks from the computer.
+ These request can be made either through the command line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI).


## Kernal:
+ Communicates between the hardware and software of a computer.
+ Manages how hardware resources are used to meet software requirements.


## Internetwork Operating System (IOS):
+ The family of network operating systems used on many Cisco devices is called the Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS).
+ Cisco IOS is used on many Cisco routers and switches regardless of the type or size of the device.
+ Other Cisco operating systems include IOS XE, IOS XR, and NX-OS.


## Firmware:
+ The operating system on home routers is usually called _firmware_.
+ The most common method for configuring a home router is by using a web browser-based GUI.


## Access Methods:
+ A switch will forward traffic by default and does not need to be explicitly configured to operate.
+ Two configured hosts connected to the same new switch would be able to communicate.
+ Common methods to connect to the switch or any network device IOS:
	+ **Console**.
	+ **Secure Shell (SSH)**.
	+ **Telnet**.
+ Some devices, such as routers, may also support a legacy auxiliary (إضافي) port that was used to establish a CLI session remotely over a telephone connection using a modem.


## Console:
+ This is a physical management port that provides out-of-band access to a Cisco device.
+ Out-of-band access refers to access via a dedicated (مخلص) management channel that is used for device maintenance purposes only.
+ The advantage of using a console port is that the device is accessible even if no networking services are configured, such as performing the initial configuration.
+ A computer running terminal emulation software and a special console cable to connect to the device are required for a console connection.


## AUX:
+ Similar to a console connection, the AUX port is out-of-band and does not require networking services to be configured or available.


## Secure Shell Protocol (SSH):
+ SSH is an in-band and recommended method for remotely establishing a secure CLI connection, through a virtual interface.
+ SSH connections require active networking services on the device, including an active interface configured with an address.


## Telnet:
+ Telnet does not provide a secure, encrypted connection and should only be used in a lab environment.
+ User authentication, passwords, and commands are sent over the network in plaintext.


## Terminal Emulation (محاكاة) Programs:
+ There are several terminal emulation programs you can use to connect to a networking device either by a serial connection over a console port, or by an SSH/Telnet connection.
+ Like :
	+ Tera Term.
	+ PuTTY.
	+ SecureCRT.
