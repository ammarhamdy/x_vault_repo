## Primary Command Modes:
+ As a security feature, the Cisco IOS software separates management access into the following two command modes: **User EXEC Mode**, and **Privileged EXEC Mode**.


## User exece mode:
+ This mode has limited capabilities but is useful for basic operations.
+ It allows only a limited number of basic monitoring commands but does not allow the execution of any commands that might change the configuration of the device.
+ The user EXEC mode is identified by the CLI prompt that ends with the > symbol.
+ It is often referred to as “view-only" mode.


## Privileged exece mode:
+ To execute configuration commands.
+ Privileged EXEC mode is sometimes called _enable mode_.
+ A network administrator must access privileged EXEC mode.
+ Higher configuration modes, like global configuration mode, can only be reached from privileged EXEC mode.
+ The privileged EXEC mode can be identified by the prompt ending with the # symbol.


## Configuration Mode and Subconfiguration Modes:
+ To configure the device, the user must enter global configuration mode, which is commonly called global config mode.
+ From global config mode, CLI configuration changes are made that affect the operation of the device as a whole.
+ Global configuration mode is identified by a prompt that ends with `(config)#` after the device name, such as `Switch(config)#`
+ From global config mode, the user can enter different sub-configuration modes like:
	+ **Line Configuration Mode** : Used to configure console, SSH, Telnet, or AUX access.
	- **Interface Configuration Mode** : Used to configure a switch port or router network interface.

## Navigate Between IOS Modes:
+ To move from _user EXEC mode_ to _privileged EXEC mode_, use the `enable` command.
+ Use the `disable` _privileged EXEC mode_ command to return to _user EXEC mode_.
+ To move in and out of global configuration mode, use the `configure terminal` _privileged EXEC mode_ command.
+ To return to the _privileged EXEC mode_, enter the `exit` _global config mode_ command.
+ To move from any subconfiguration mode to the _privileged EXEC mode_, enter the `end` command or enter the key combination `Ctrl+Z`.
+ You can also move directly from one subconfiguration mode to another.
