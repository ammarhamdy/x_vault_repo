# Configure Router Interfaces

At this point, your routers have their basic configurations. 

The next step is to configure their interfaces. 

This is because routers are not reachable by end devices until the interfaces are configured. 

There are many different types of interfaces available on Cisco routers. 

For example, the Cisco ISR 4321 router is equipped with two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces:
- **`GigabitEthernet 0/0/0 (G0/0/0)`**
- **`GigabitEthernet 0/0/1 (G0/0/1)`**


The task to configure a router interface is very similar to a management SVI on a switch. 
Specifically, it includes issuing the following commands:
```
Router(config)# interface type-and-number
Router(config-if)# description description-text
Router(config-if)# ip address ipv4-address subnet-mask
Router(config-if)# ipv6 address ipv6-address/prefix-length
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
```
**Note**: The _description-text_ is limited to 240 characters.

Using the **no shutdown** command activates the interface and is similar to powering on the interface. 

The interface must also be connected to another device, such as a switch or a router, for the physical layer to be active.

```
R1> enable
R1# configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line.
End with CNTL/Z.
R1(config)# interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/0
R1(config-if)# description Link to LAN
R1(config-if)# ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
R1(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:acad:10::1/64
R1(config-if)# no shutdown
R1(config-if)# exit
R1(config)#
```

```
R1(config)# interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/1
R1(config-if)# description Link to R2
R1(config-if)# ip address 209.165.200.225 255.255.255.252
R1(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:feed:224::1/64
R1(config-if)# no shutdown
R1(config-if)# exit
R1(config)#
```

## Verify Interface Configuration

There are several commands that can be used to verify interface configuration. 

The most useful of these is the **`show ip interface brief`** and **`show ipv6 interface brief`** commands

| **show ip interface brief**  <br>**show ipv6 interface brief** | The output displays all interfaces, their IP addresses, and their current status. The configured and connected interfaces should display a Status of “up” and Protocol of “up”. Anything else would indicate a problem with either the configuration or the cabling. |
| **show ip route**  <br>**show ipv6 route**                     | Displays the contents of the IP routing tables stored in RAM.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **show interfaces**                                            | Displays statistics for all interfaces on the device. However, this command will only display the IPv4 addressing information.                                                                                                                                       |

# Configure the Default Gateway

## Default Gateway on a Host

If your local network has only one router, it will be the gateway router and all hosts and switches on your network must be configured with this information. 

If your local network has multiple routers, you must select one of them to be the default gateway router. 

This topic explains how to configure the default gateway on hosts and switches.

For an end device to communicate over the network, it must be configured with the correct IP address information, including the default gateway address. 

The default gateway is only used when the host wants to send a packet to a device on another network. 

The default gateway address is generally the router interface address attached to the local network of the host. 

The IP address of the host device and the router interface address must be in the same network.

**For example**
assume an IPv4 network topology consisting of a router interconnecting two separate LANs. 

`G0/0/0` is connected to network `192.168.10.0`, while `G0/0/1` is connected to network `192.168.11.0`. 
Each host device is configured with the appropriate default gateway address.

In this example, if ``PC1`` sends a packet to `PC2`, then the default gateway is not used. 
![[Pasted image 20250118105226.png]]

What if `PC1` sent a packet to `PC3`? `PC1` would address the packet with the IPv4 address of `PC3`, but would forward the packet to its default gateway, which is the `G0/0/0` interface of `R1`. 

The router accepts the packet and accesses its routing table to determine that `G0/0/1` is the appropriate exit interface based on the destination address. 

`R1` then forwards the packet out of the appropriate interface to reach `PC3`.

## Default Gateway on a Switch
A switch that interconnects client computers is typically a Layer 2 device. 

As such, a Layer 2 switch does not require an IP address to function properly. 

However, an IP configuration can be configured on a switch to give an administrator remote access to the switch.

To connect to and manage a switch over a local IP network, it must have a **==switch virtual interface (SVI)==** configured.

The SVI is configured with an IPv4 address and subnet mask on the local LAN. 

The switch must also have a default gateway address configured to remotely manage the switch from another network.

The default gateway address is typically configured on all devices that will communicate beyond their local network.

To configure an IPv4 default gateway on a switch, use the 
`ip default-gateway _ip-address_` global configuration command. 

The `_ip-address_` that is configured is the IPv4 address of the local router interface connected to the switch.
