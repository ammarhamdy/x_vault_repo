## Cable:
+ Typically offered by cable television service providers, the internet data signal transmits on the same cable that delivers cable television.
+ It provides a high bandwidth, high availability, and an always-on connection to the internet.


## Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL):
+ Digital Subscriber Lines also provide high bandwidth, high availability, and an always-on connection to the internet.
+ DSL runs over a telephone line.
+ In general, small office and home office users connect using Asymmetrical DSL (ADSL), which means that the download speed is faster than the upload speed.

## Satellite:
+ The availability of satellite internet access is a benefit in those areas that would otherwise have no internet connectivity at all.


## Dial-up Telephone:
+ An inexpensive option that uses any phone line and a modem.

## Businesses Internet Connections:
+ Corporate (شركة كبرى) connection options differ from home user options.

## Dedicated Leased Line (الخط المؤجر المخصص):
+ Leased lines are reserved circuits within the service provider’s network that connect geographically separated offices for private voice and/or data networking.
+ The circuits are rented at a monthly or yearly rate.


## Metro Ethernet:
+ This is sometimes known as Ethernet WAN.
+ Metro ethernets extend LAN access technology into the WAN.


## Business Symmetric Digital Subscriber (DSL):
+ Business DSL is available in various formats.
+ A popular choice is Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL) which is similar to the consumer version of DSL but provides uploads and downloads at the same high speeds.


## Satellite:
+ Satellite service can provide a connection when a wired solution is not available.
