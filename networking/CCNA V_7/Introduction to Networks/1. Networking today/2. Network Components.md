## Hosts:
+ All computers that are connected to a network and participate (يشارك) directly in network communication are classified as hosts.
+ Hosts can be called end devices.
+ Some hosts are also called clients.
+ However, the term hosts specifically refers to devices on the network that are assigned a number for communication purposes. 
+ This number identifies the host within a particular network.
+ This number is called the Internet Protocol (IP) address.
+ An IP address identifies the host and the network to which the host is attached.


## Servers:
+ Servers are computers with software that allow them to provide information to other end devices on the network.
+ ==Each service requires separate server software.==
+ For example, a server requires web server software in order to provide web services to the network.
+ A computer with server software can provide services simultaneously (معًا) to many different clients.


## Host and servers:
+ Clients have software for requesting and displaying the information obtained (تم الحصول عليها) from the server.
+ An example of client software is a web browser like edge or fire-fox.
+ A single computer can also run multiple types of client software:
	+ For example, a user can check email and view a web page while instant messaging and listening to an audio stream.

## Common types of server software.
| Type | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Email | The email server runs email server software. Clients use mail client software, such as Microsoft Outlook, to access email on the server. |
| Web | The web server runs web server software. Clients use browser software, such as Windows Internet Explorer, to access web pages on the server. |
| File | The file server stores corporate and user files in a central location. The client devices access these files with client software such as the Windows File Explorer. |


## Peer-to-Peer:
+ Client and server software usually run on separate computers.
+ But it is also possible for one computer to be used for both roles at the same time. In small businesses and homes.
+  This type of network is called a peer-to-peer network.
+ In the figure, the print sharing PC has a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection to the printer and a network connection, using a network interface card (NIC), to the file sharing PC.

## The advantage of peer to peer networking:
+ Easy to setup.
+ Less complex.
+ Lower cost (no network devices are required).
+ Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers.


## The disadvantage of peer to peer networking:
+ No centralized administration.
+ Not a secure.
+ Not scalable.
+ All devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance.


## End Devices:
+ The network devices that people are most familiar with are end devices.
+ An end device is either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network.
+ To distinguish (يميز) one end device from another, each end device on a network has an address.
+ When an end device initiates communication, it uses the address of the destination end device to specify where to deliver the message.

## Intermediary Devices:
+ Intermediary devices connect the individual end devices to the network.
+ They can connect multiple individual networks to form an internetwork.
+ These intermediary devices provide connectivity and ensure that data flows across the network.
+ Like:
	+ Wireless Router.
	+ LAN switch.
	+ Router.
	+ Multilayer switch.
	+ Firewall application.



## Network Media:
+ Communication transmits across a network on media.
+ The media provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination.
+ Modern networks primarily use three types of media to interconnect devices:
	+ **Metal wires within cables**: Data is encoded into electrical impulses.
	+ **Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable)**: Data is encoded into pulses of light.
	+ **Wireless transmission**: Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves.


## Criteria (معايير) for choosing network media:
+ What is the maximum distance that the media can successfully carry a signal?
+ What is the environment in which the media will be installed?
+ What is the cost of the media and installation.
+ What is the amount of data and at what speed must it be transmitted.
