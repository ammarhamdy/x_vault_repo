## Networks of Many Sizes:
+ Networks come in all sizes.
+ **Simple home networks** let you share resources, such as printers.
+ **Small office and home office (SOHO) networks** allow people to work from home, or a remote office.
+ **Businesses and large organizations use networks** to provide consolidation, storage, and access to information on network servers.
+ **The internet** is the largest network in existence. 
+ In fact, the term internet means a “network of networks”; It is a collection of interconnected private and public networks.


## Network infrastructures vary (يتغير) greatly in terms of:
+ Size of the area covered.
+ Number of users connected.
+ Number and types of services available.
+ Area of responsibility.


## LANs and WANs:
+ The two most common types of network infrastructures are Local Area Networks (LANs), and Wide Area Networks (WANs).


## Local Area Networks (LAN):
+ A LAN is a network infrastructure that provides access to users and end devices in a ==small geographical area.==
+ A LAN is typically used in a department within an enterprise, a home, or a small business network.
+ LANs interconnect end devices in a limited area such as a home, school, office building, or campus.
+ A LAN is usually administered by a single organization or individual.


## Wide Area Network (WAN):
+ A WAN is a network infrastructure that provides access to other networks ==over a wide geographical area.==
+ Is typically owned and managed by a larger corporation or a telecommunications service provider.
+ WANs are typically managed by service providers (SPs) (مقدمي الخدمة) or Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
+ WANs interconnect LANs over wide geographical areas such as between cities, states, provinces, countries (بلدان), or continents (القارات).
+ WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers.
+ WANs typically provide slower speed links between LANs.


## A WAN conntects three LANS:

## The Internet:
+ Interconnected (مترابط) networks (internetworks).
+ The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (internetworks, or internet for short).
+ The internet is not owned by any individual or group.
+ There are organizations that were developed to help maintain the structure and standardization of internet protocols and processes:
	+ These organizations include the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
	+ Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
	+ The Internet Architecture Board (IAB).


## Intranets and Extranets:
+ There are two other terms which are similar to the term internet: intranet and extranet.


### Intranet:
+ Intranet is a term often used to refer to a `private` connection of LANs and WANs that belongs to an organization.
+ An intranet is designed to be accessible only by the organization's members, employees, or others with authorization.


### Extranet:
+ An organization may use an extranet to provide `secure and safe access` to individuals who work for a different organization but require access to the organization’s data.
+ Here are some examples of extranets:
	+ A company that is providing access to outside suppliers and contractors.
	+ A hospital that is providing a booking system to doctors so they can make appointments for their patients.
	+ A local office of education that is providing budget and personnel information to the schools in its district.
