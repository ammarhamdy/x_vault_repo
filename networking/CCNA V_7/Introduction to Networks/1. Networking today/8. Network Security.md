## Network security:
+ Network security is an integral (أساسي) part of computer networking.
+ Securing a network involves protocols, technologies, devices, tools, and techniques in order to protect data and mitigate (يخفف من) threats.


## Internal VS external thread:
+ Threat vectors may be external or internal

## Common external threats:
+ **Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses**: 
	+ These contain malicious software or code running on a user device.
+ **Spyware and adware**: 
	+ These are types of software which are installed on a user’s device.
	+ The software then secretly collects information about the user.
+ **Zero-day attacks**:
	+ Also called zero-hour attacks.
	+ These occur on the first day that a vulnerability becomes known.
+ **Threat actor (الممثل) attacks**:
	+ A malicious person attacks user devices or network resources.
+ **Denial of service attacks**:
	+ These attacks slow or crash applications and processes on a network device.
+ **Data interception and theft (سرقة)**:
	+ This attack captures private information from an organization’s network.
+ **Identity theft**:
	+ This attack steals the login credentials of a user in order to access private data.


## Security Solutions:
+ No single solution can protect the network from the variety of threats that exist. 
+ For this reason, security should be implemented in multiple layers


### Basic security components for a home:
+ **Antivirus and antispyware**.
+ **Firewall filtering**: Firewall filtering blocks unauthorized access into and out of the network.


## Security requirements:
+ **Dedicated firewall systems**: 
	+ These provide more advanced firewall capabilities that can filter large amounts of traffic with more granularity (تقسيمات).
+ **Access control lists (ACL)**: 
	+ These further filter access and traffic forwarding based on IP addresses and applications.
+ **Intrusion (التدخل) prevention systems (IPS)**:
	+ These identify fast-spreading threats, such as zero-day or zero-hour attacks.
+ **Virtual private networks (VPN)**:
	+ These provide secure access into an organization for remote workers.
