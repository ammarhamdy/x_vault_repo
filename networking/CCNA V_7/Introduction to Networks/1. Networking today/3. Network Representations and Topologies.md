## Network Representations:
+ Network architects and administrators must be able to show what their networks will look like.
+ They need to be able to easily see which components connect to other components.

## Specialized terminology
+ Specialized terminology is used to describe how each of these devices and media connect to each other:
	+ **Network Interface Card (NIC)**.
	+ **Physical Port**.
	+ **Interface**.


## Network Interface Card (NIC):
+ A NIC physically connects the end device to the network.


## Port vs interface

### Physical Port:
+ A connector or outlet (مَنفَذ) on a networking device where the media connects to an end device or another networking **device**.

### Interface:
+ Specialized ports on a networking device that connect to individual networks.

### The terms port and interface are often used interchangeably.


## Topology Diagrams:
+ Topology Diagrams provide a visual map of how the network is connected.
+ Topology diagrams are mandatory (إلزامي) documentation for anyone working with a network.
+ There are two types of topology diagrams: physical and logical.



## Physical Topology (البنية) Diagrams:
+ Physical topology diagrams illustrate the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation.

## Logical Topology (البنية) Diagrams:
+ Logical topology diagrams illustrate devices, ports, and the addressing scheme of the network.
