## Addresses in networking:
+ In networking, IPv4 addresses are represented using the decimal base ten number system and the binary base 2 number system. 
+ IPv6 addresses and Ethernet addresses are represented using the hexadecimal base sixteen number system.
+ **==An Ethernet MAC address consists of a 48-bit binary value.==**
+ Hexadecimal is used to identify an Ethernet address because a single hexadecimal digit represents four binary bits.
+ Therefore, a **==48-bit==** Ethernet MAC address can be expressed using only 12 hexadecimal values.


### Hex vs Bin:
+ One hexa represents four binary bits.
```
0000 in binary = 0 in hexa
00000000 in binary = 00 in hexa
11111111 in binary = FF in hexa
```
+ When using hexadecimal, leading zeroes are always displayed to complete the 8-bit representation.
+ Hexadecimal numbers are often represented by the value preceded by **0x** (e.g., 0x73)
+ Hexadecimal may also be represented by a subscript 16, or the hex number followed by an H (e.g., 73H).


## Ethernet MAC Address:
+ **==An Ethernet MAC address is a 48-bit address expressed using 12 hexadecimal digits.==**
+ Because a byte equals 8 bits, we can also say that a MAC address is **==6 bytes==** in length.
+ In an Ethernet LAN, every network device is connected to the same, shared media.
+ The MAC address is used to identify the physical source and destination devices (NICs) on the local network segment.
+ MAC addressing provides a method for device identification at the data link layer of the OSI model.


### Unique MAC:
+ All MAC addresses must be unique to the Ethernet device or Ethernet interface.
+ To ensure this, all vendors that sell Ethernet devices must register with the IEEE to obtain a unique 6 hexadecimal (i.e., 24-bit or 3-byte) code called the ==organizationally unique identifier (OUI).==
+ When a vendor assigns a MAC address to a device or Ethernet interface, the vendor must do as follows:
	+ Use its assigned OUI as the first 6 hexadecimal digits.
	+ Assign a unique value in the last 6 hexadecimal digits.

### MAC example:
+ For example, assume that Cisco needs to assign a unique MAC address to a new device. The IEEE has assigned Cisco a OUI of **00-60-2F**.
+ Cisco would then configure the device with a unique vendor code such as **3A-07-BC**.
+ Therefore, the Ethernet MAC address of that device would be **00-60-2F-3A-07-BC.**


### MAC On ROM:
+ Sometimes the MAC address is referred to as a burned-in address (BIA) because the address is hard coded into read-only memory (ROM) on the NIC.
+ This means that the address is encoded into the ROM chip permanently.
+ It is possible to change the MAC address in software.
+ ___When the computer boots up, the NIC copies its MAC address from ROM into RAM.___


### Ethernet can't live without MAC:
+ Any device that is the source or destination of an Ethernet frame, will have an Ethernet NIC and therefore, a MAC address.
+ This includes workstations, servers, printers, mobile devices, and routers.


## Unicast MAC Address
+ In Ethernet, different MAC addresses are used for Layer 2 unicast, broadcast, and multicast communications.
+ A unicast MAC address is the unique address that is used when a frame is sent from a single transmitting device to a single destination device.
+ The source MAC address must always be a unicast.


## ARP and ND:
+ The process that a source host uses to determine the destination MAC address associated with an IPv4 address is known as ==**Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).**==
+ The process that a source host uses to determine the destination MAC address associated with an IPv6 address is known as Neighbor Discovery (ND).
+ ==**ARP Requests do not use IPv4, but the ARP message is sent as an Ethernet broadcast.**==


## Broadcast MAC Address:
+ An Ethernet broadcast frame is received and processed by every device on the Ethernet LAN.
+ The features of an Ethernet broadcast are as follows:
	+ ==It has a **destination** MAC address of **FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF**== in hexadecimal (48 ones in binary).
	+ It is flooded out all Ethernet switch ports except the incoming port.
	+ ***It is not forwarded by a router***.
+ DHCP for IPv4 is an example of a protocol that uses Ethernet and IPv4 broadcast addresses.
+ ARP Requests do not use IPv4, but the ARP message is sent as an Ethernet broadcast.


## Multicast MAC Address:
+ An Ethernet multicast frame is received and processed by a group of devices on the Ethernet LAN that belong to the same multicast group.
+ The features of an Ethernet multicast are as follows:
	+ There is a destination MAC address of `01-00-5E` when the encapsulated data is an IPv4 multicast packet and a destination MAC address of `33-33` when the encapsulated data is an IPv6 multicast packet.
	+ There are other reserved multicast destination MAC addresses for when the encapsulated data is not IP, such as Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP).
	+ It is flooded out (غمرت) all Ethernet switch ports except the incoming port, unless the switch is configured for multicast snooping (التطفل).
	+ It is not forwarded by a router, unless the router is configured to route multicast packets.


## multicast group:
+ If the encapsulated data is an IP multicast packet, the devices that belong to a multicast group are assigned a multicast group IP address.
+ The range of IPv4 multicast addresses is `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`.
+ The range of IPv6 multicast addresses begins with ff00::/8.
+ Because multicast addresses represent a group of addresses (sometimes called a host group), they can only be used as the destination of a packet. 
+ The source will always be a unicast address.


## MAC address shapes:
+ MAC addresses are also called physical addresses, hardware addresses, or Ethernet hardware addresses.
+ hexadecimal digits that are usually separated by dashes, colons, or periods.
+ MAC address using the three different notation methods: 
	+ `00-05-9A-3C-78-00` 
	+ `00:05:9A:3C:78:00 `
	+ `0005.9A3C.7800`
