## Static and dynamic address:
+ Static ARP entries are entries added to the ARP table manually using `arp -s` command.
+ Dynamic ARP entries are entries discovered dynamically using ARP protocol.
+ ==**When the host needs to communicate with a new IP and does not know its physical address, it will broadcast an ARP request asking for the hardware/MAC address of the host that owns the IP.**==


## Play with my MAC table
+ Show my own MAC table using `arp -a` command:
```
PS C:\Users\ammar> arp -a

Interface: 192.168.1.5 --- 0xd
  Internet Address      Physical Address      Type
  192.168.1.1           c0-fd-84-9a-21-7f     dynamic
  192.168.1.255         ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff     static
  224.0.0.22            01-00-5e-00-00-16     static
  224.0.0.251           01-00-5e-00-00-fb     static
  224.0.0.252           01-00-5e-00-00-fc     static
  239.255.255.250       01-00-5e-7f-ff-fa     static
```
+ My ip address is `192.168.1.5`.
+ There is a dynamic ip address in my table in this case the address `192.168.1.1` is for my getway.
+ Try to Connect with another device that you know it's ip address using `ping` command:
```
PS C:\Users\ammar> ping 192.168.1.7

+ The new device with `192.168.1.7` ip address been added to our mac and it's MAC address has been known `7e-8e-dc-f4-a9-a5`.


## Static addresses in arp:
+ First address:
	+ `192.168.1.255         ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff     static`.
	+ The broad cast address for our network.
+ Next three address:
	+ `224.0.0.22            01-00-5e-00-00-16     static`
	+ `224.0.0.251           01-00-5e-00-00-fb     static`
	+ `224.0.0.252           01-00-5e-00-00-fc     static`
	+ This address for multicast.


### IPv4 multicast addresses:
+ IPv4 multicast addresses are defined by the most-significant bit pattern of `1110`. 
+ This originates from the classful network design of the early Internet when this group of addresses was designated as Class D.
+ The CIDR notation for this group is `224.0.0.0/4`. 
+ The group includes the addresses from `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`. 
+ Address assignments from within this range are specified in RFC 5771, an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Best Current Practice document (BCP 51).


## Ethernet and multicast:
+ A multicast packet is not directed to one host but a number of hosts.
+ So the destination MAC address will not match the unique MAC address of any computer, but the computers which are part of the multicast group will recognise the destination MAC address and accept it for processing.
+ Ethernet uses the low-order bit of the high-order octet to distinguish conventional unicast addresses from multicast addresses.
+ A unicast would have this bit set to ZERO (0), whereas a multicast would be set to ONE (1).

+ ![[Pasted image 20230319191512.png]]
+ the destination MAC address `01-00-5E-00-00-05` is not the MAC address of a particular host-computer but the MAC address that can be recognized by computers that are part of the multicast group.
+ Note that you will never find a source address that is a multicast MAC address, the source address will always be a real one.
