- NIC:
	- network interface card.

- USB:
	- Universal Serial Bus.


- intermediary devices:
	- connect multiple individual networks to form an internetwork.
	- provide connectivity and ensure that data flows across the network.
	- router, switch, multilayer switch, wireless router.


- Network Media:
	- The media provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination.
	- Modern networks primarily use three types of media to interconnect devices:
		- **Metal wires within cables** - Data is encoded into electrical impulses.
		- **Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable)** - Data is encoded into pulses of light.
		- **Wireless transmission** - Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves.


- The four main criteria for choosing network media are these:
	-   What is the maximum distance that the media can successfully carry a signal?
	-   What is the environment in which the media will be installed?
	-   What is the amount of data and at what speed must it be transmitted?
	-   What is the cost of the media and installation?

- Internet:
	- The internet is the largest network in existence.
	- In fact, the term internet means a “network of networks”.
	- It is a collection of interconnected private and public networks.



- LAN and WAN:
	- The two most common types of network infrastructures are Local Area Networks (LANs), and Wide Area Networks (WANs).
	- A LAN is a network infrastructure that provides access to users and end devices in a small geographical area.
	- A WAN is a network infrastructure that provides access to other networks over a wide geographical area, which is typically owned and managed by a larger corporation or a telecommunications service provider.


- WAN:
	- WANs interconnect LANs over wide geographical areas such as between cities, states, provinces, countries, or continents.
	- WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers.
	- WANs typically provide slower speed links between LANs.


- Internet:
	- The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (internetworks, or internet for short).
	- The internet is not owned by any individual or group.
	- There are organizations that were developed to help maintain the structure and standardization of internet protocols and processes.
	- These organizations include the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), and the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), plus many others.


- Intranet:
	- Intranet is a term often used to refer to a private connection of LANs and WANs that belongs to an organization.
	- An intranet is designed to be accessible only by the organization's members, employees, or others with authorization.
	- An organization may use an extranet to provide secure and safe access to individuals who work for a different organization but require access to the organization’s data.
