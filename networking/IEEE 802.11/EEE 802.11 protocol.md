The **IEEE 802.11 protocol** is the family of standards that defines how **Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)** (commonly known as Wi-Fi) work. 

It specifies how devices (like laptops, smartphones, routers, and IoT gadgets) communicate wirelessly over short to medium ranges.

IEEE 802.11 defines the rules for **wireless communication (Wi-Fi)** — covering how data is transmitted over radio waves, how devices share the air medium, and how they securely connect. Over time, new amendments have improved speed, reliability, and security.

# Overview

- **Developed by:** IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) LAN/MAN Standards Committee.
    
- **First release:** 1997 (original 802.11 standard).
    
- **Purpose:** To define the **physical layer (PHY)** and **media access control (MAC)** for wireless communication.
    
- **Applications:** Internet access in homes, offices, public hotspots, IoT connectivity, industrial networks, etc.


# Main Components

1. **Stations (STA):** Devices with wireless network interfaces (e.g., phones, laptops).
    
2. **Access Point (AP):** Connects wireless devices to a wired network (like a Wi-Fi router).
    
3. **Basic Service Set (`BSS`):**
    - **Infrastructure mode:** Stations connect via an AP (most common).
    - **Ad hoc mode:** Stations connect directly without AP.
        
4. **Extended Service Set (`ESS`):** Multiple APs connected together to cover a larger area.


# Layers of IEEE 802.11

1. **Physical Layer (`PHY`):**    
    - Defines frequencies, modulation, data rates.
    - Operates in **2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz** bands (depending on version).
    - Uses modulation schemes like **`DSSS`, `OFDM`, `QAM`**.
    
2. **MAC Layer:**
    - Controls how devices share the wireless medium.
    - Uses **`CSMA`/`CA` (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)**.
    - Provides functions like **authentication, association, fragmentation, retransmission**.


# Medium Access Control (How Wi-Fi avoids collisions)

- Devices check if the channel is free before transmitting.
    
- If busy, they **wait a random back-off time**.
    
- Uses **ACK frames** to confirm delivery.
    
- Supports **`RTS`/`CTS` (Request to Send / Clear to Send)** for reducing hidden-node collisions.


# Security

- Originally: **`WEP` (Wired Equivalent Privacy)** – weak and broken.
    
- Replaced by: **`WPA`, `WPA2`, `WPA3`** – using stronger encryption (`AES`).


# Evolution of 802.11 Standards
- **802.11 (1997):** 2 Mbps, 2.4 GHz.
- **802.11b (1999):** 11 Mbps, 2.4 GHz.
- **802.11a (1999):** 54 Mbps, 5 GHz.
- **802.11g (2003):** 54 Mbps, 2.4 GHz.
- **802.11n (2009):** 600 Mbps, MIMO, 2.4/5 GHz.
- **802.11ac (2014):** Several Gbps, 5 GHz, MU-MIMO.
- **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6, 2019):** Higher efficiency, OFDMA, up to 9.6 Gbps, 2.4/5 GHz.
- **802.11be (Wi-Fi 7, expected 2024+):** Even faster, lower latency, 6 GHz support.


# Key Features

- **Mobility:** Devices can roam تجول between APs within an `ESS`.

- **Scalability:** Supports many users in dense environments (e.g., stadiums).

- **QoS (Quality of Service):** Prioritizes traffic (e.g., video calls vs. background downloads).

- **Interoperability:** Works across different vendors (due to IEEE standardization).
