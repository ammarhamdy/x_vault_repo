# Scanning Websites with Nikto

`Nikto` is a web scanning tool available on Kali. 

It performs banner grabbing and runs a few basic checks to determine if the web server uses security headers to mitigate known web vulnerabilities; these vulnerabilities include
+ Cross-site scripting (XSS), which is a client-side injection vulnerability targeting web browsers.
+ UI ==redressing== (also known as ==clickjacking==), a vulnerability that lets attackers use decoy layers in a web page to hijack user clicks.

The security headers indicate to browsers what to do when loading certain resources and opening URLs, protecting the user from falling victim to an attack.

After performing these security checks, `Nikto` also sends requests to
possible endpoints on the server by using its built-in wordlist of common paths. 

The requests can discover interesting endpoints that could be useful for penetration testers. 

Let’s use Nikto to perform a basic web assessment of the three web servers we’ve identified on the IP addresses.

```sh
nikto -host ${target} -port 3306
```


# Brute-Forcing Directories with `dirsearch`

The `dirsearch` fast directory brute-forcing tool is used to find hidden paths and files on web servers. 

Written in Python by `Mauro Soria`, `dirsearch` provides features such as built-in web directory wordlists, bring-your-own-dictionary options, and advanced response filtering.

```sh
dirsearch -u http://172​.16​.10​.10:8081/
```

# Fuzzing for Hidden Files

Fuzzers generate semi-random data to use as part of a payload. 

When sent to an application, these payloads can trigger anomalous behavior or reveal covert information.

Creating a wordlist of Possible Filenames:
```sh
echo -e acme-hyper-branding-{0..100}.{txt,csv,pdf,jpg}"\n" | sed 's/ //g' > files_wordlist.txt
```

## Fuzzing with `ffuf`

```sh
ffuf -c -w files_wordlist.txt -u http://172​.16​.10​.10:8081​/files/FUZZ
```
For more: [[ffuf]]

## Fuzzing with `Wfuzz`

`Wfuzz` is another web fuzzing tool similar to `ffuf`. 
In fact, `ffuf` is based on `Wfuzz`.

```sh
wfuzz --sc 200 -w files_wordlist.txt http://172​.16​.10​.10:8081​/files/FUZZ
```
`--sc 200` : filtering capabilities to show only files that receive a
response status code of 200 OK


# Assessing SSH Servers with Nmap’s Scripting Engine

Nmap contains many `NSE` scripts to test for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

All Nmap scripts live in the `/usr/share/nmap/scripts` path. 

When you run Nmap with the `-A` flag, it will blast all `NSE` scripts at the target, as well as enable operating system detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute. 

==This is probably the **noisiest** scan you can do with Nmap, so never use it when you need to be covert==.

```sh
nmap --script=ssh-auth-methods 172.16.10.13
```

The `ssh-auth-methods` `NSE` script enumerates the authentication methods offered by the SSH server. 

If password is one of them, this means that the server accepts passwords as an authentication mechanism. 

SSH servers that allow password authentication are prone to brute-force attacks.
