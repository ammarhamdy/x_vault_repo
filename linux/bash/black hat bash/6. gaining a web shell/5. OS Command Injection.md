OS command injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application allows users to execute unauthorized operating system commands by supplying them as input to the application.

We must identify places in the target application that rely directly on user input to construct operating system commands.


# Bypassing Command Injection Restrictions

## Obfuscation and Encoding
When we sent commands to a web shell earlier in this chapter, URL encoding requirements posed a challenge we needed to overcome.

Techniques like URL encoding, `base64` encoding, and character encoding can hide the payload from security controls, checks, and filters.

For example, we could `base64-encode` an entire command, such as `ls -l`
```sh
echo 'bHMgLWw=' | base64 -d   # ls -l
```


## Globbing
Globbing is the process of using wildcard patterns to partially or fully match filenames or other content in files.
```sh
ls -l /etc/p?sswd
```

```sh
ls /??c/{p????d,g???p}
```
That start with `p` and end with `d`, as well as files that start with `g` and end with `p`. 
This should match files such as `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group`
