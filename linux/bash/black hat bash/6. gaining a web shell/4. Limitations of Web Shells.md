# Lack of Real-Time Responses
Real-time responses from commands such as a ping won’t work, and unless you limit the number of ping commands you send, your web shell may hang, as hotkeys like `ctrl-C` to exit the command won’t be available.

# Limited Functionality
Web shells often provide limited feedback or error messages, making it challenging to troubleshoot issues or understand the underlying cause of failures.
They provide only a subset of the functionality available through
native system administrative tools.
