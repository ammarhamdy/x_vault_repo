## What is the Compression: 
+ Compression reduces the amount of data needed to store or transmit a file while storing it in such a way that the file can be restored.
+ The compressed version of the file is not typically viewed or utilized, instead, it is decompressed before use.


## Compression types: 
+ When talking about compression, there are two types:
	+ Lossless.
	+ Lossy.


### Lossless compression:
- Lossless: No information is removed from the file. 
- Compressing a file and decompressing it leaves something identical to the original


### Lossy compression:
- Lossy: Information might be removed from the file. 
- It is compressed in such a way that un-compressing a file will result in a file that is slightly different from the original. 
- For instance, an image with two subtly different shades of green might be made smaller by treating those two shades as the same. 
- Often, the eye can’t pick out the difference anyway.


### Lossy vs. Lossless Comparison:

|Compression Type|Example Formats|Data Loss?|Use Cases|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Lossless**|ZIP, PNG, FLAC|❌ No|Documents, source code, spreadsheets, some images/audio|
|**Lossy**|JPEG, MP3, MP4|✅ Yes|Multimedia where small loss in quality is acceptable|

## When Lossy or Lossless:
+ Lossy compression often benefits media because it results in smaller file sizes and people can’t tell the difference between the original and the version with the changed data. 
+ For things that must remain intact, such as documents, logs, and software, you need lossless compression.


## Double comptess:
+ Compressing an already compressed file will not make it smaller. 
+ This fact is often forgotten when it comes to images since they are already stored in a compressed format.
+ With lossless compression, this multiple compression is not a problem, but if you compress and decompress a file several times using a lossy algorithm, you will eventually have something that is unrecognizable.


## `gzip` command:
+ Linux provides several tools to ==compress files==; the most common is `gzip`.

+ The `gzip` command will provide this information, by using the `–l` option, as shown here:

## Decompression:
+ Compressed files can be restored to their original form using either the `gunzip` command or the `gzip –d` command. 
+ This process is called decompression.
 + The `gunzip` command is just a script that calls `gzip` with the right parameters.


## Other commands:
+ There are other commands that operate virtually identically to `gzip` and `gunzip`.
+ These include `bzip2` and `bunzip2`, as well as `xz` and `unxz`.


## `bzip` command:
+ The `gzip` command uses the ==**Lempel-Ziv**== data compression algorithm, while the `bzip` utilities use a different compression algorithm called ==**Burrows-Wheeler**== block sorting, which can compress files smaller than `gzip` at the expense of more CPU time.
+ These files can be recognized because they have a `.bz` or `.bz2` extension instead of a `.gz` extension.


## `xz` command:
+ The `xz` and `unxz` tools are functionally similar to `gzip` and `gunzip` in that they use the ==**Lempel-Ziv-Markov (LZMA)**== chain algorithm, which can result in lower decompression CPU times that are on par with `gzip` while providing the better compression ratios typically associated with the `bzip2` tools. 
+ Files compressed with the `xz` command use the `.xz` extension.
