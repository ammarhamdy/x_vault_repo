File archiving is used when one or more files need to be transmitted or stored as efficiently as possible.



## Archiving vs Compression: 
- Archiving: Combines multiple files into one, which eliminates the overhead in individual files and makes the files easier to transmit.
- Compression: Makes the files smaller by removing redundant information.


## Archiving and compressing:
+ Files can be compressed individually, or multiple files can be combined into a single archive and then subsequently compressed. 
+ The latter is still referred to as archiving.


## Un-archiving:
+ When an archive is decompressed, and one or more files are extracted, this is called un-archiving.
