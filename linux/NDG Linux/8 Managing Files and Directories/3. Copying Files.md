The `cp` command is used to copy files. 
It requires a source and a destination. 
The structure of the command is as follows:
```
cp source destination
```



----
# Verbose (مطول) Mode


The `-v` option causes the `cp` command to produce output if successful. 
The `-v` option stands for verbose:
```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cp -v /etc/hosts ~
`/etc/hosts' -> `/home/sysadmin/hosts'
```


To give the new file a different name, provide the new name as part of the destination:
```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cp /etc/hosts ~/hosts.copy
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  hosts      Documents  Music      Public    Videos     hosts.copy 
```

# Avoid Overwriting Data


## When overwriting happend:
+ The `cp` command can be destructive to existing data if the destination file already exists.
+ In the case where the destination file exists, the `cp` command overwrites the existing file's contents with the contents of the source file.


## Interactive option:
+ Two options can be used to safeguard against accidental overwrites.
+ With the `-i` interactive option, the `cp` command prompts the user before overwriting a file.
+ The `-i` option requires you to answer `y` or `n` for every copy that could end up overwriting an existing file's contents. 
+ This can be tedious when a bunch of overwrites occur, such as the example demonstrated below:

+ To answer `n` to each prompt automatically, use the `-n` option. It stands for no clobber (ضرب بقسوة), or no overwrite.

# Copying Directories



By default, the `cp` command will not copy directories; any attempt to do so results in an error message
However, the recursive `-r` option allows the `cp` command to copy both files and directories.
```
cp -r source_directory destination_directory
```
