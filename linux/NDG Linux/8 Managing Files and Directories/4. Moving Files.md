To move a file, use the `mv` command.
```
mv source destination
```

# Renaming Files


The `mv` command is not just used to move a file, but also to rename a file. 
If the destination for the `mv` command is a directory, the file is moved to the directory specified. 
The name of the file only changes if a destination file name is also specified.
If a destination directory is not specified, the file is renamed using the destination file name and remains in the source directory.

# Additional Move Options


Like the `cp` command, the `mv` command provides the following options:


|Option|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`-i`|Interactive: Ask if a file is to be overwritten.|
|`-n`|No Clobber: Do not overwrite a destination file's contents.|
|`-v`|Verbose: Show the resulting move.|

There is no `-r` option as the `mv` command moves directories by default.
