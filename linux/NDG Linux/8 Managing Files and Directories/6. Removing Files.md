To delete a file, use the `rm` command.
Note that the files were deleted with no questions asked.
This could cause problems when deleting multiple files by using glob characters.

s a precaution, users should use the `-i` option when deleting multiple files:
```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ rm -i *.txt                     rm: remove regular empty file `example.txt'? y        rm: remove regular empty file `sample.txt'? n         rm: remove regular empty file `test.txt'? y  
```

# Removing Directories


To delete a directory with the rm command, use the `-r `recursive option
When a user deletes a directory, all of the files and sub-directories are deleted without any interactive question.
It is best to use the `-i` option with the `rm` command.


You can also delete a directory with the `rmdir` command, but only if the directory is empty.
