# Additional System Documentation



On most systems, there is a directory where additional documentation (such as documentation files stored by third-party software vendors) is found.

These documentation files are often called readme files since the files typically have names such as `README` or `readme.txt`. The location of these files can vary depending on the distribution that you are using. Typical locations include `/usr/share/doc` and `/usr/doc`.

Typically, this directory is where system administrators go to learn how to set up more complex software services. However, sometimes regular users also find this documentation to be useful.
