## Man page disadvantages:
+ Man pages are excellent sources of information, but they do tend to have a few disadvantages. One example is that each man page is a separate document, not related to any other man page. 
+ While some man pages have a `SEE ALSO` section that may refer to other man pages, they tend to be independent sources of documentation.


## `info` command:
+ The `info` command also provides documentation on operating system commands and features. 
+ The goal is slightly different from man pages: to provide a documentation resource that gives a logical organizational structure, making reading documentation easier.
+ All of the documentation is merged into a single "book" representing all of the documentation available. 
+ Within info documents, information is broken down into categories that work much like a table of contents in a book. 
+ Hyperlinks are provided to pages with information on individual topics for a specific command or feature.
+ Another advantage of info over man pages is that the writing style of info documents is typically more conducive (تؤدي) to learning a topic.
+ ==Consider man pages to be more of a reference resource and info documents to be more of a learning guide.==

# Viewing Info Documentation


To display the info documentation for a command, use the `info` command.
```
info command
```

+ This documentation is broken up into nodes, and in the example above the line highlighted in white shows it’s currently in the `ls invocation` node. The first line provides index information about the current location within the document. 
+ The next node, like the next chapter in a book, would be the `dir invocation` node. 
+ Going up one level is the `Directory listing` node.
+ Scrolling through the document, notice the menu for the `ls` command:

+ The items under the menu are hyperlinks that link to nodes that describe more about the `ls` command.
+ For example, placing the cursor on the line `* Sorting the output::` and pressing the **Enter** key, leads to a node that describes sorting the output of the `ls` command:

+ Note that going into the node about sorting leads into a sub-node of the original. To go back to the previous node, use the **U** key. 
+ While **U** leads to the start of the node one level up, the **L** key returns to the same location as before entering the sorting node.

# Navigating Info Documents


Like the `man` command, a listing of movement commands is available by hitting the **Shift**+**H** key while reading the info documentation

Note that to close the help screen type the **L** key, which brings back the current document.
To quit entirely, use the **Q** key.

# Exploring Info Documentation


Instead of using info documentation to look up information about a specific command or feature, consider exploring the capabilities of Linux by reading through the info documentation. 
Execute the `info` command without any arguments to be taken to the top level of the documentation. 
This is a good starting point to explore many of the features offered:
