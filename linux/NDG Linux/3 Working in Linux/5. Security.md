# Password Issues


## Root:
+ Good password management is essential to security in any computing environment.
+ The Linux systems administrator is often the person responsible for setting and enforcing password policies for users at all levels.
+ The most privileged user on any Linux system is root; this account is the primary administrator and is created when the operating system is installed. 
+ Often administrators will disable root access as the first line of defense against intrusion since computer hackers will try to gain root access in order to take control of the system.


## Levels:
+ There are many levels of access and various means of password management on a Linux system.
+ When users are created, they are given different login permissions depending on what groups they are assigned to.
+ For example, administrators can create and manage users while regular users cannot.
+ Services that run on systems such as databases can also have login permissions with their own passwords and privileges. 
+ Additionally, there are specific passwords for accessing systems remotely through SSH, FTP, or other management programs.

# Protecting Yourself


## Footprint:
+ As you browse the web, you leave a digital footprint. Much of this information goes ignored; some of it is gathered to collect statistics for advertising, and some can be used for malicious purposes.


## Choose password:
+ The easiest thing you can do is to use a good, unique password everywhere you go, especially on your local machine.
+ A good password is at least 10 characters long and contains a mixture of numbers, letters (both upper and lower case) and special symbols.
+ Use a password manager like **KeePassX** to generate passwords, and then you only need to have a login password to your machine and a password to open up your KeePassX file.


## Ubuntu firewall:
+ Finally, you should protect your computer from accepting incoming connections. A firewall is a device that filters network traffic, and Linux has one built-in. If you are using Ubuntu, then the **Gufw** is a graphical interface to **Ubuntu’s Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)**.
+ ![[Pasted image 20240213204342.png]]
+ Under the hood, you are using **iptables**, which is the built-in firewall system. Instead of entering complicated iptables commands you use a GUI. 
+ While this GUI lets you build an effective policy for a desktop, it barely scratches the surface of what iptables can do.

# Privacy Tools


## Encryption:
+ Encryption is probably the best-known and most widely-deployed privacy tool in use today.
+ Administrators deploy encryption with authentication keys on almost every system that communicates with the outside world.
+ One well-known example is the **HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)** standard used on web servers to ensure that data transmitted between users and online resources cannot be intercepted as it travels on the open Internet.



## VPN:
+ Virtual private networks (VPN) have been in use by companies to connect their remote servers and employees for many years. 
+ Now they are gaining popularity amongst ordinary users looking to protect their privacy online. 
+ They work by creating an encrypted channel of communication between two systems, so the data transmitted between them is scrambled by an algorithm only the systems know.


## Tor project:
+ The **Tor** project has long been involved in creating privacy tools like it’s **Tor Browser** that works by relaying internet requests through a network of servers that prevents websites and others from learning the identity of the person making the request.
