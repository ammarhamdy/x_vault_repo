Control statements allow you to use multiple commands at once or run additional commands, depending on the success of a previous command.
Typically these control statements are used within scripts, but they can also be used on the command line as well.

# Semicolon


## Command after command: 
+ The semicolon ; character can be used to run multiple commands, one after the other.
+ Each command runs independently and consecutively; regardless of the result of the first command, the second command runs once the first has completed, then the third and so on.

# Double Ampersand


## And:
+ The double ampersand && acts as a logical "and"; if the first command is successful, then the second command will also run.
+ If the first command fails, then the second command will not run.
```bash
am@ubuntu:~$ ls && echo success
Android  Android_projects  cv_debug.log  Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  snap  Templates  Vault  Videos  x_vault
success

am@ubuntu:~$ ls no && echo success
ls: cannot access 'no': No such file or directory
```

# Double Pipe


```bash
command1 || command2
```


## Or: 
+ The double pipe `||` is a logical "or".
+ Depending on the result of the first command, the second command will either run or be skipped.
+ With the double pipe, if the first command runs successfully, the second command is skipped; if the first command fails, then the second command is run.
+ In other words, you are essentially telling the shell, =="Either run this first command or the second one”==.
+ In the following example, the `echo` command only executes if the `ls` command fails:
```bash
am@ubuntu:~$ ls nothing || echo fails
ls: cannot access 'nothing': No such file or directory
fails

am@ubuntu:~$ ls || echo fails
Android  Android_projects  cv_debug.log  Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  snap  Templates  Vault  Videos  x_vault
