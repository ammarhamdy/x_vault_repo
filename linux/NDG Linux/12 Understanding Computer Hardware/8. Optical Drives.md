Optical drives, often referred to as CD-ROMs, DVDs, or Blu-Ray, are removable storage media.

While some devices used with optical disks are read-only, others are capable of burning (writing to) disks, when using a writable type of disk.

There are various standards for writable and rewritable disks, such as CD-R, CD+R, DVD+RW, and DVD-RW.


Modern distributions often mount the disks under the `/media` folder, while older distributions typically mount them under the `/mnt` folder. 

For example, a USB thumb drive might be mounted on the `/media/usbthumb` path.


When the user is finished using the disk, it is necessary to unmount it using a menu or the `umount` command.
