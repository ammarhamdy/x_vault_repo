While the phrase hard disk is typically considered to encompass traditional spinning disk devices, it can also refer to the newer and very different solid state drives or disks.


Solid state disks are essentially larger capacity USB thumb drives in construction and function. 

As there are no moving parts, and no spinning disks, just memory locations to be read by the controller, a solid state disk is measurably and visibly faster in accessing the information stored in its memory chips.


A solid state disk is controlled by an embedded or onboard processor that makes the decisions as to where and how data is written and read back from the memory chips when requested.
