In order to display output to the monitor, the computer system must have a video display device (video card) and a monitor. 

Video display devices are often directly built into or attached to the motherboard, although they can also be connected through the PCI bus slots on the motherboard.

With the large array of video device vendors, each video display device usually requires a proprietary driver provided by the vendor.

All drivers, but most especially video device drivers, must be written for the specific operating system, something that is commonly done for Microsoft Windows, but not always for Linux. 

Fortunately, most of the larger video display vendors now provide at least some level of Linux support. 

The Linux community has done an incredible amount of work developing standard drivers for video cards.


## Video cables:

There are three types of video cables commonly used:

1. the older but still used analog 15-pin Video Graphics Array (VGA) cable

2. the more recent 29-pin Digital Visual Interface (DVI) interface

3. the very widely-used High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) which supports resolutions up to the 4K or Ultra HD range, and has either 19 or 29 pins

4. the newest digital display interface, the 20-pin DisplayPort (DP). 
+ Also its miniaturized counterpart (نظيره المصغر), the Mini DisplayPort, ==used mainly for Apple products.==

For monitors to work correctly with video display devices, they must be able to support the same resolution as the video display device. 

Normally, the software driving the video display device can automatically detect the maximum resolution that the video display and monitor can both support and set the screen resolution to that value.
