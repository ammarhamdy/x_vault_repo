It's safe to say that there is a Linux distribution specifically designed for just about all modern hardware platforms, and for many historical platforms as well.

Each of these hardware platforms has a great deal of variety in the components that are available. 

In addition to several different types of hard drives, there are many different graphics cards, monitors and printers. 

With the popularity of USB devices, such as USB storage devices, cameras, and mobile phones, the number of available devices you would want to connect to a Linux system can number in the thousands.

The sheer (محض) number of different devices poses (يطرح) problems as these hardware devices typically need drivers, software that allows them to communicate with the installed operating system.


## Drivers:

The driver could be compiled as part of the Linux kernel, loaded into the kernel as a module, or loaded by a user command or application. 

External devices, like scanners and printers, typically have their drivers loaded by an application and these drivers, in turn, communicate through the device via the kernel through an interface such as USB.


Commercial distributions like Red Hat and SUSE have web pages dedicated to listing hardware that is certified or approved to work with their software.
