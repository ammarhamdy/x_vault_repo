The motherboard typically has slots where random-access memory (RAM) can be connected to the system. 

The 32-bit architecture systems can use up to 4 gigabytes (GB) of RAM, while 64-bit architectures are capable of addressing and using far more RAM.

In some cases, the RAM a system has might not be enough to handle all of the operating system requirements. 
Once invoked, programs are loaded in RAM along with any data they need to store, while instructions are sent to the processor when they execute.


## Swap space (virtual RAM):
+ When the system is running low on RAM, virtualized memory called ==swap space== is used to temporarily store data to disk.
+ Data stored in RAM that has not been used recently is moved over to the section of the hard drive designated as swap, freeing up more RAM for use by currently active programs.
+ If needed, this swapped data can be moved back into RAM at a later time.
+ The system does all of this automatically as long as swap is configured.



## `free` command:
+ To view the amount of RAM in your system, including the swap space, execute the `free` command. 
+ The `free` command has a `-m` option to force the output to be rounded to the nearest megabyte (MB) and a `-g` option to force the output to be rounded to the nearest gigabyte (GB):
