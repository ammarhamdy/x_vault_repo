A bus is a high-speed connection that allows communication between computers or the components inside a computer. 

The motherboard has buses that allow for multiple devices to connect to the system, including the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) and Universal Serial Bus (USB). 

The motherboard also has connectors for monitors, keyboards and mice.


## Buses on small computers:
+ Increasingly for laptop and light/thin/small form factor computers, the majority of the computer’s components may be directly connected to the motherboard, including the usual processor, RAM, as well as additional components like the network card.
+ In this configuration, the bus still exists, but ==effectively one of the main convenience factors of being able to swap out or upgrade devices is no longer a possibility==.

# Peripheral Devices


Peripheral devices are components connected to a computer that allow input, output or data storage. 

Keyboards, mice, monitors, printers and hard disks are all considered peripherals and are accessed by the system in order to perform functions outside of central processing. 

To view all of the devices connected by the PCI bus, the user can execute the `lspci` command.


## Example:
The following is a sample output of this command. 
The highlighted sections show this system has a ==VGA controller (a monitor connector)==, an ==SCSI storage controller (a type of hard drive)== and an ==Ethernet controller (a network connector)==:

# Universal Serial Bus Devices


Devices connected internally are usually cold-plug, meaning the system must be shut down in order to connect or disconnect a device. 

USB devices are hot-plug, meaning they can be connected or disconnected while the system is running.

Though USB devices are hot-plug by design, it's important to ensure that any mounted filesystems are correctly unmounted, or data loss and corruption of the filesystem may occur.

To display the devices connected to the system via USB, execute the `lsusb` command:
