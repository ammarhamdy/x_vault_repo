## Linux distribution:
+ Linux users typically obtain an operating system by downloading a distribution.
+ **A Linux distribution is** ==a bundle of software==, typically comprised of the 
	+ Linux kernel.
	+ Utilities. 
	+ Management tools. 
	+ And even some application software in a package which also includes the means to update core software and install additional applications.
+ The distribution takes care of setting up the storage, building the kernel and installing hardware drivers, as well as installing applications and utilities to make a fully functional computer system.
+ The organizations that create distributions also include tools to manage the system, a ==package manager== to add and remove software, as well as update programs to provide security and functionality patches.
+ The number of Linux distributions available numbers in the hundreds, so the choice can seem daunting (شاقة) at first.
+ However, the decision points are mostly the same as those highlighted for choosing an operating system.


## Role:
* With Linux, there are multiple options to choose from depending on organizational needs.
* The variety of distributions and accompanying (مصاحب) software allows the operating system to be significantly more flexible and customize-able.
* Distributions are available for a much wider variety of systems, from commercial offerings for the traditional server or desktop roles, to specialized distributions designed to turn an old computer into a network firewall; from distributions created to power a supercomputer, to those that enable embedded systems.
* These might focus on running application or web servers, productivity desktops, point-of-sale systems, or even tools dedicated to electronics design or statistical computing.


## Function:
+ Governments and large enterprises may also limit their choices to distributions that offer commercial support because paying for another tier (الطبقة) of support may be better than risking extensive outages (الانقطاعات). 
+ For the most part, concerns over security have been addressed through the large open source community, which monitors kernel changes for vulnerabilities and provides bug reporting and fixes at a much larger scale than closed source vendors can achieve.
+ Support for necessary applications may vary and is, therefore, an additional consideration.
+ Often application vendors choose a subset of distributions to support.
+ Different distributions have different versions of key libraries, and it is difficult for a company to support all these different versions. 
+ However, some applications like Firefox and LibreOffice are widely supported and available for all major distributions.


## Life Cycle:
+ Most distributions have both major and minor (الرئيسية و الثانوية) update cycles to introduce new features and fix existing bugs.
+ Additionally, there are development packages where users can contribute code and submit patches for possible inclusion into new releases.


### Linux distributions categories:
+ Linux distributions can be broadly classed in two main categories: 
	+ Enthusiast (متحمس) 
	+ Enterprise (مَشرُوع).


#### Enthusiast distribution
+ An enthusiast distribution such as openSUSE’s Tumbleweed (أعشاب) has a fast update cycle, is not supported for enterprise and may not contain (or drop) features or software in the next version that are in the current one.
+ Red Hat’s Fedora project uses a similar method of development and release cycle, as does Ubuntu Desktop.


#### Enterprise distributions:
+ Enterprise distributions are almost the exact opposite, in that they take care to be stable and consistent, and offer enterprise-grade support for extended periods, anywhere from 5-13 years in the case of SUSE.
+ Enterprise distributions are fewer by far (أقل بكثير), being offered mainly by Red Hat, Canonical (معياري) and SUSE.


## Application software: 
+ Application software may be written such that it only supports a specific release of a distribution, requiring users to remain on an older, less secure operating system than they might like.
+ Therefore, some Linux releases are considered to have long-term support (LTS) of 5 years or more while others are only supported for two years or less.


## Stability:
+ Some distributions offer stable, testing, and unstable releases.
+ When choosing an unstable release for required features, consideration must be given to the fact that those features may change at any point during the development cycle.
+ When features have been integrated into the system for a long time, with most of the bugs and issues addressed, the software moves through testing into the stable release.



+ Other releases depend on beta distributions.
+ For instance, the Fedora distribution releases beta or pre-releases of its software ahead of the full release to minimize bugs.
+ Fedora is often considered the community-oriented beta release of RedHat.
+ Features are added and changed in the Fedora release before finding their way into the enterprise-ready RedHat distribution.


+ openSUSE and its enterprise counterpart SLES (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server) are similar, in that the community edition is used as a testing ground for the features and functions that will eventually be migrated into the enterprise version.
+ Previously somewhat dissimilar, later versions of the openSUSE and SLES distribution codebases are nearly identical, allowing for easier migration of features and code from one to the other.


## **Consider This**:
+ The Debian distribution warns users about the pitfalls of using the “sid” (unstable) release with the following warning:
	+ ‘"sid" is subject to massive changes and in-place library updates. This can result in a very "unstable" system which contains packages that cannot be installed due to missing libraries, dependencies that cannot be fulfilled, etc. Use it at your own risk!’


## Cost:
+ Your chosen Linux distribution itself might be zero cost, but paying for support may be worthwhile depending on organizational needs and capabilities.


## Interface:
+ Like most operating systems, Linux can be used in one of two ways: graphical (GUI) and non-graphical (CLI).


## Terminal:
+ The CLI environment is provided by an application on the computer known as a terminal. ‌⁠​⁠​ The terminal accepts what the user types and passes to a shell. 
+ The shell interprets what the user has typed into instructions that can be executed by the operating system.
+ If output is produced by the command, then this text is displayed in the terminal.
+ If problems with the command are encountered, then an error message is displayed.
+ In CLI mode there are no windows to move around. Text editors, web browsers, and email clients are all presented in text format only. 
+ This is how UNIX operated before graphical environments were the norm. Most servers run in this mode too, since people don’t log into them directly, making a graphical interface a waste of resources.

# Linux Distributions


## Red Hat:
+ **Red Hat** started as a simple distribution that introduced the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM). 
+ The developer eventually formed a company around it, which tried to commercialize (تسويق) a Linux desktop for business. 
+ Over time, Red Hat started to focus more on the server applications, such as web- and file-serving and released **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**, which was a paid service on a long release cycle. 
+ The release cycle dictates (يملي) how often software is upgraded. 
+ A business may value stability and want long release cycles, while a hobbyist or a startup may want the latest software and opt for a shorter release cycle. 
+ To satisfy the latter group, Red Hat sponsors (الرعاة) the **Fedora Project** which makes a personal desktop comprising (تضم) the latest software but is still built on the same foundations as the enterprise version.


### CentOs: 
+ Because everything in Red Hat Enterprise Linux is open source, a project called **CentOS** came to be. 
+ It recompiled all the RHEL packages (converting their source code from the programming language they were written into language usable by the system) and gave them away for free.
+ CentOS and others like it (such as Scientific Linux) are largely compatible with RHEL and integrate some newer software, but do not offer the paid support that Red Hat does.

### Scientific Linux:
+ **Scientific Linux** is an example of a specific-use distribution based on Red Hat.
+ The project is a Fermilab-sponsored distribution designed to enable scientific computing.
+ Among its many applications, Scientific Linux is used with particle accelerators including the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.


## SUSE:
+ **SUSE**, originally derived from **Slackware**, was one of the first comprehensive (شامل) Linux distributions, it has many similarities to Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
+ The original company was purchased by Novell in 2003, which was then purchased by the Attachmate Group in 2011.
+ The Attachmate group then merged with Micro Focus International in 2014, and in 2018 SUSE announced plans to go forward as an independent business.
+ Through all of the mergers and acquisitions, SUSE has managed to continue and grow.
+ While SUSE Linux Enterprise contains proprietary code and is sold as a server product, **openSUSE** is a completely open, free version with multiple desktop packages similar to CentOS and Linux Mint.


## Debian:
+ **Debian** is more of a community effort, and as such, also promotes the use of open source software and adherence (الالتزام) to standards.
+ Debian came up with its own package management system based on the `.deb` file format.
+ While Red Hat leaves non-Intel and AMD platform support to derivative (المشتق) projects, Debian supports many of these platforms directly.
+ **Ubuntu** is the most popular Debian-derived distribution.


### Canonical company:
+ It is the creation of **Canonical** (العنوان الأساسي), a company that was made to further the growth of Ubuntu and makes money by providing support.
+ Ubuntu has several different variants for desktop, server and various specialized applications. 
+ They also offer an LTS version that is kept up-to-date for 3 years on desktops and 5 years on servers, which gives developers and the companies they work for confidence to build solutions based on a stable distribution.


### Linux Mint:
+ **‌⁠⁠Linux Mint** was started as a fork of Ubuntu Linux, while still relying upon the Ubuntu repositories. 
+ There are various versions, all free of cost, but some include proprietary codecs (برامج الترميز), which cannot be distributed without license restrictions in certain countries.


## Android:
+ Linux is a kernel, and many of the commands covered in this course are actually part of the GNU package. 
+ That is why some people insist (يصر) on using the term **GNU/Linux** instead of Linux alone.
+ **Android**, sponsored by Google, is the world’s most popular Linux distribution.
+ It is fundamentally different from its counterparts (نظرائه).
+ Android uses the **Dalvik** virtual machine with Linux, providing a robust platform for mobile devices such as phones and tablets. 
+ However, lacking the traditional packages that are often distributed with Linux (such as GNU and Xorg), Android is generally incompatible with desktop Linux distributions.
+ This incompatibility means that a Red Hat or Ubuntu user cannot download software from the Google Play store.
+ Likewise, a terminal emulator in Android lacks many of the commands of its Linux counterparts.
+ It is possible, however, to use BusyBox with Android to enable most commands to work.


## Other distributions:
+ **Raspbian** is a specialized Linux distribution optimized to run on **Raspberry Pi** hardware.
+ This combination has seen significant use in training for programmers and hardware designers at all levels.
+ Its low cost and ease of use have made it a favorite of educators worldwide, and many add-on devices are available to extend its capabilities into the physical world.
+ There is a multitude of labs and projects available that teach everything from environmental monitoring to circuit design, machine learning, and robotics.


## Linux From Scratch (LFS):
+ **Linux From Scratch (LFS)** is more of a learning tool than a working distribution. 
+ This project consists of an online book, and source code, with “step-by-step instructions” for building a custom Linux distribution from the source code up.
+ This “distribution” embodies the true spirit of Linux whereby users can modify any aspect of the operating system and learn how all the pieces work together.
+ It’s also a good starting point for anyone who needs specialized functionality or an ultra-compact build for an embedded system project.

# Embedded Systems


## Start of linux:
+ Linux started out as something that would only run on a computer like Linus Torvald's: an Intel 386 PC with a specific hard drive controller, but since anyone could add to or change Linux, people started building support for other hardware. 
+ Eventually, Linux started supporting other chips with an emphasis on small size and low power consumption.
+ Because of this flexibility, a significant number of device makers have used Linux as the operating system for their hardware products.
+ Today we call these embedded systems because they are designed to do a specific task on hardware optimized for only that purpose.
+ These systems encompass a tremendous diversity of devices that are used today, from cell phones to smart TVs and appliances, to remote monitoring systems for pipelines and factories.
