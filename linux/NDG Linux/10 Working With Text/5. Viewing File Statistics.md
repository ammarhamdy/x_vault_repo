The `wc` command provides the number of lines, words and bytes (1 byte = 1 character in a text file) for a file, and a total line count if more than one file is specified.
By default, the `wc` command allows for up to three statistics to be printed for each file provided, as well as the total of these statistics if more than one filename is provided:
```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ wc /etc/passwd /etc/passwd-
  35   56 1710 /etc/passwd
  34   55 1665 /etc/passwd-
  69  111 3375 total  
```
The output of the previous example has four columns:
1. Number of lines
2. Number of words
3. Number of bytes
4. File name


It is also possible to view only specific statistics, by using the `-l` option to show just the number of lines, the `-w` option to show just the number of words, the `-c` option to show just the number of bytes, or any combination of these options.


The `wc` command can be useful for counting the number of lines output by some other command through a pipe.
For example, if you wanted to know the total number of files in the `/etc` directory, pipe the output of `ls` to `wc` and count only the number of lines:
```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls /etc/ | wc -l
142
```
