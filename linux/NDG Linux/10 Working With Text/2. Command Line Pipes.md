The pipe `|` character can be used to send the output of one command to another.

The examples below illustrate this using the `nl` command, which adds line numbers to the output. 
In the first example, the `nl` command is used to number the lines of the output of the preceding `ls` command
```bash
ls /etc/ssh | nl | tail -5
```
