When most people refer to Linux, they are really referring to a combination of software called **GNU/Linux**, which defines the operating system.
==GNU is the free software that surrounds the kernel and provides open source equivalents of many common UNIX commands.==
The Linux part of this combination is the Linux kernel, which is the core of the operating system.
The kernel is loaded at boot time and stays running to manage every aspect of the functioning system.


## Kernel functions: 
+ Key functions of the Linux kernel include a system call interface, process management, memory management, virtual filesystems, networking, and device drivers.
+ In short, via a shell, the kernel accepts commands from the user and manages the processes that carry out those commands by giving them access to devices such as memory, disks, network interfaces, keyboards, mice, monitors and more.


## Important files:
+ A typical Linux system has thousands of files. The **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard** provides a guideline for distributions on how to organize these files.
+ It is important to understand the role of the Linux kernel and how it both processes and provides information about the system under the `/proc` and `/sys` pseudo filesystems.
