## List command `ls`:
+ On many Linux distributions, including the one used in our virtual machines, the `ls` command uses color to distinguish by file type. 
+ For example, directories may be displayed in blue, executable files may be displayed in green, and symbolic links may be displayed in cyan.
+ Colored output is not the default behavior for the `ls` command, but rather the effect of the `--color` option.
+ The `ls` seems to perform this coloring automatically because there is an alias for the `ls` command, so it runs with the `--color` option.
```bash
am@ubuntu:~$ type ls
ls is aliased to `ls --color=auto'
```
+ ==To avoid using the alias, place a backslash character== `\` ==in front of your command==:

# Listing Hidden Files


## Hidden file:
+ The `ls` command omits hidden files by default.
+ A hidden file is any file (or directory) that begins with a dot `.` character.
+ To display all files, including hidden files, use the `-a` option to the `ls` command


## Why hidden files:
+ Why are files hidden in the first place? Most of the hidden files are customization files, designed to customize how Linux, your shell or programs work.
+ For example, the `.bashrc` file in the home directory customizes features of the shell, such as creating or modifying variables and aliases.
+ These customization files are not ones that you work with on a regular basis, and having them displayed makes it more difficult to find other files.

# Long Display Listing


## Metadata:
+ ==Each file has details associated with it called metadata==.
+ This can include information such as the size, ownership, or timestamps. 
+ To view this information, use the `-l` option to the `ls` command.

### The file types:
+ The first character of each line indicates the type of file. The file types are:
![[Pasted image 20240223083150.png]]

|Symbol|File Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`d`|directory|A file used to store other files.|
|`-`|regular file|Includes readable files, images files, binary files, and compressed files.|
|`l`|symbolic link|Points to another file.|
|`s`|socket|Allows for communication between processes.|
|`p`|pipe|Allows for communication between processes.|
|`b`|block file|Used to communicate with hardware.|
|`c`|character file|Used to communicate with hardware.|


### Permissions:
![[Pasted image 20240223083208.png]]
+ The next nine characters demonstrate the permissions of the file. Permissions indicate how certain users can access a file.


### Hard Link Count:
![[Pasted image 20240223083244.png]]
+ This number indicates how many hard links point to this file.


### User Owner:
![[Pasted image 20240223083311.png]]
+ Every file is owned by a user account.
+ This is important because the owner has the rights to set permissions on a file.


### Group Owner:
![[Pasted image 20240223083355.png]]
+ Indicates which group owns this file.
+ This is important because any member of this group has a set of permissions on the file.


### File Size:
![[Pasted image 20240223083444.png]]
+ Displays the size of the file in bytes.
+ ==For directories, this value does not describe the total size of the directory, but rather how many bytes are reserved to keep track of the filenames in the directory.==
+ In other words, ignore this field for directories.


### Timestamp:
![[Pasted image 20240223083630.png]]
+ ==Indicates the time that the file's contents were last modified.== 
+ ==For directories, this timestamp indicates the last time a file was added or deleted from the directory.==


### File Name:
![[Pasted image 20240223083716.png]]
+ The final field contains the name of the file or directory.
+ In the case of symbolic links, the link name is displayed along with an arrow and the pathname of the original file.

# Human-Readable Sizes


The `-l` option to the `ls` command displays file sizes in bytes. For text files, a byte is 1 character. 
For smaller files, byte sizes are fine. However, for larger files, it is hard to comprehend how large the file is.
To accomplish this, add the `-h` option to the `ls` command


==**Important:** The `-h` option must be used with the `-l` option.==



---
# Listing Directories



When the `-d` option is used, it refers to the current directory, and not the contents within it.
To use the `-d` option in a meaningful way requires the addition of the `-l` option.


n comparison, the next command lists the `/home/sysadmin` directory itself:
```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -ld                          
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin 224 Nov  7 17:07 .
```
Note the single period at the end of the long listing. This indicates that the current directory is being listed, and not the contents.


---
# Recursive Listing


There are times when you want to display all of the files in a directory as well as all of the files in all sub-directories under that directory. 
This is called a recursive listing.
To perform a recursive listing, use the `-R` option to the `ls` command
==Limit the use of recursive listings to smaller directory structures.==



---
# Sort a Listing


## Sort by size:
+ By default, the `ls` command sorts files alphabetically by file name. 
+ Sometimes, it may be useful to sort files using different criteria.
+ To sort files by ==size==, we can use the `-S` option.



## Sort by last modified time:
+ The `-t` option sorts files based on the time they were modified. 
+ It will list the most recently modified files first.


## Directory time:
+ ==It is important to remember that the modified date on directories represents the last time a file was added to or removed from the directory.==


## Full time option:
+ For more detailed modification time information you can use the `--full-time` option to display the complete timestamp
![[Pasted image 20240223085843.png]]


## Reverse sort:
+ It is possible to perform a reverse sort by using the `-r` option.
+ It can be used alone, or combined with either the `-S` or `-t` options. The following command will sort files by size, smallest to largest:
```bash
ls -lrS /etc/ssh
```
