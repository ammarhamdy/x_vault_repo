## directory structure In Windows:
+ On a Windows system, the top level of the directory structure is called My Computer. 
+ Physical devices, such as hard drives, USB drives, network drives, show up under My Computer and are each assigned a drive letter, such as C: or D:.

## Directory structure on Linux:
+ Like Windows, the Linux directory structure, typically called a filesystem, also has a top level.
+ However instead of My Computer, it is called the root directory, and it is symbolized by the slash `/` character.
+ Additionally, there are no drives in Linux; each physical device is accessible under a directory, as opposed to a drive letter.

# Home Directory


## Where is the home:
+ The term home directory often confuses new Linux users.
+ To begin with, on most Linux distributions there is a directory called `home` under the root `/` directory.
![[Pasted image 20240222050223.png]]
+ Under this `/home` directory there is a directory for each user on the system. 
+ The directory name is the same as the name of the user, so a user named `sysadmin` would have a home directory called `/home/sysadmin`.
+ the home directory is one of the few directories where the user has full control to create and delete additional files and directories.



## Home directory charachter:
+ It is also possible to refer to another user's home directory by using the tilde `~` character followed by the name of the user account. 
+ For example, `~bob` would be the equivalent of `/home/bob`.

# Current Directory



To determine where the user is currently located within the filesystem, the `pwd` (print working directory) command can be used



---
# Changing Directories


## Change directory command:
+ To navigate the filesystem, use the `cd` (change directory) command.
+ When used with no arguments, the `cd` command will take the user to their home directory.
+ To move from the home directory into the `Documents` directory use the directory name as an argument to the `cd` command


## No news is good news:
+ For some commands, ==no news is good news==; there is no output if the `cd` command is successful.
+ If the user tries to change to a directory that does not exist, the command returns an error message.
