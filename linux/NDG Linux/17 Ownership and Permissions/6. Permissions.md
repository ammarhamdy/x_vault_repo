The output of the `ls -l` command displays ten characters at the beginning of each line. 

These characters indicate the type of file and the permissions of the file.

## Permission Types

Each group is attributed three basic types of permissions: read, write, and execute.

The permissions themselves are deceptively simple and have a different meaning depending on whether they are applied to a file or a directory.

**Read**:
The first character of each group represents the read permission.
There is an `r` character if the group has the read permission, or a `-` character if the group does not.

**Write**:
The second character of each group represents the write permission.
There is a `w` character if the group has the write permission, or a `-` character if the group does not.


**Execute**:
The third character of each group represents the execute permission. 
There is an `x` character if the group has the execute permission, or a `-` character if the group does not.
