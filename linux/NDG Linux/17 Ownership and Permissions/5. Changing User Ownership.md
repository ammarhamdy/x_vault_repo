The `chown` command allows the root user to change the user ownership of files and directories.

A regular user cannot use this command to change the user owner of a file.


## `chown` cmmand:

There are three different ways the `chown` command can be executed. 

The first method is used to change just the user owner of the file.

```sh
chown user /path/to/file
```

The second method is to change both the user and the group.

To accomplish this, you separate the user and group by either a colon or a period character.

```sh
chown user:group /path/to/file
chown user.group /path/to/file
```

If a user doesn't have root privileges, they can use the third method to change the group owner of a file just like the `chgrp` command. 

To use `chown` only to change the group ownership of the file, use a colon or a period as a prefix to the group name:

```sh
chown :group /path/to/file
chown .group /path/to/file
```
