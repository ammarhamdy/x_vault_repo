If you know that the file you are about to create should belong to a group different from your current primary group, then you can use the `newgrp` command ==to change your current primary group.==

```sh
newgrp group_name
```

## `groups` command:

If you are only interested in knowing what groups you belong to, then you can execute the `groups` command:

```sh
am@ubuntu:~$ groups
am adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev users lpadmin
```


## `newgrp` command:

The `newgrp` command opens a new shell; as long as the user stays in that shell, the primary group won't change. 

To switch the primary group back to the original, the user can leave the new shell by running the `exit` command.

```sh
sysadmin@localhost:~$ id
uid=1001(sysadmin) gid=1005(research) groups=1005(res..
sysadmin@localhost:~$ exit
sysadmin@localhost:~$ id
uid=1001(sysadmin) gid=1001(sysadmin) groups=1001(sys..
```

Administrative privileges are required to change the primary group of the user permanently. 

The root user would execute the following command:

```sh
usermod -g groupname username
```
