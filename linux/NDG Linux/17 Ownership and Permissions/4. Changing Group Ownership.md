To change the group owner of an existing file the `chgrp` command can be used.

```sh
chgrp group_name file
```

## `chgrp` command:

As the root user, the `chgrp` command can be used to change the group owner of any file to any group. 

As a user without administrative privileges, the `chgrp` command can only be used to change the group owner of a file to a group that the user is already a member of:

```sh
am@ubuntu:~$ touch sample
am@ubuntu:~$ ls -l sample
-rw-rw-r-- 1 am am 0 May 28 07:57 sample
am@ubuntu:~$ chgrp adm sample
am@ubuntu:~$ ls -l sample
-rw-rw-r-- 1 am adm 0 May 28 07:57 sample
```


To change the group ownership of all of the files of a directory structure, use the recursive `-R` option to the `chgrp` command.


## `stat` command:

The `stat` command displays more detailed information about a file, including providing the group ownership both by group name and GID number:

```sh
am@ubuntu:~$ stat sample
  File: sample
  Size: 0         	Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file
