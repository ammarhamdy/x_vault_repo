The `chmod` (change mode) command is used to change permissions on files and directories.

There are two techniques that can be used with this command: symbolic and numeric.

```sh
chmod new_permission file_name
```

==To change a file's permissions, you either need to own the file or log in as the root user.==


## Symbolic Method

Start by using one or more of the following characters to indicate which permission group(s) to apply the changes to:

| `u` | user owner                                |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `g` | group owner                               |
| `o` | others                                    |
| `a` | all (user owner, group owner, and others) |

Then choose one of the following operators to indicate how to modify the permissions:

| `+` | add    |
| --- | ------ |
| `-` | remove |
| `=` | equals |

Lastly, use the following characters to specify the permissions type(s) to change:

| `r` | read    |
| --- | ------- |
| `w` | write   |
| `x` | execute |


```sh
chmod g+w abc.txt
# -rw-rw-r-- 1 root root 0 Dec 19 18:58 abc.txt
```

```sh
chmod ug+x,o-r abc.txt
# -rwxrwx--- 1 root root 0 Dec 19 18:58 abc.txt
```

```sh
chmod u=rx abc.txt
# -r-xrwx--- 1 root root 0 Dec 19 18:58 abc.txt
```


## Numeric Method

The numeric method (also called the octal method) is useful when changing many permissions on a file.

| 4   | 100 | Read    |
| --- | --- | ------- |
| 2   | 010 | Write   |
| 1   | 001 | Execute |

By using a combination of numbers from 0 to 7:

| 7   | 111 | `rwx` |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| 6   | 110 | `rw-` |
| 5   | 101 | `r-x` |
| 4   | 100 | `r--` |
| 3   | 011 | `-wx` |
| 2   | 010 | `-w-` |
| 1   | 001 | `--x` |
| 0   | 000 | `---` |

Recall the `stat` command provides more detailed information than the `ls -l` command.
One big advantage of the `stat` command is that it shows permissions using both the symbolic and numeric methods.

```sh
sysadmin@localhost:~$ stat /tmp/filetest1
  File: /tmp/filetest1
  Size: 0         	Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file

```
