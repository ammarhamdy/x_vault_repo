## `last` command:
+ The `last` command reads the entire login history from the `/var/log/wtmp` file and displays all logins and reboot records by default. 
+ An interesting detail of the reboot records is that it displays the version of the Linux kernel that was booted instead of the login location.
+ The `/var/log/wtmp` file keeps a log of all users who have logged in and out the system.

+ The `last` command is slightly different from the `who` and `w` commands. 
+ By default, it also shows the username, terminal, and login location, not just of the current login sessions, but previous sessions as well.
+ Unlike the `who` and `w` commands, it displays the date and time the user logged into the system. 
+ If the user has logged off the system, then it will display the total time the user spent logged in, otherwise it will display `still logged in`.


## Where this information come from:
+ The `who` command reads from the `/var/log/utmp` file which logs current users, while the `last` command reads from the `/var/log/wtmp` file, which keeps a history of all user logins.
