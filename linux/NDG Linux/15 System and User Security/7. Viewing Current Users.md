## `who` command:
+ The `who` command displays a list of users who are currently logged into the system, where they are logged in from, and when they logged in. 
+ Through the use of options, this command is also able to display information such as the current runlevel (a functional state of the computer) and the time that the system was booted.
```
sysadmin@localhost:~$ who
root     	tty2        2013-10-11 10:00
sysadmin	tty1        2013-10-11 09:58 (:0)
sysadmin 	pts/0       2013-10-11 09:59 (:0.0)
sysadmin 	pts/1       2013-10-11 10:00 (example.com)
```
+ The following describes the output of the `who` command:


### Username:
> ==root==     	tty2        2013-10-11 10:00
+ This column indicates the name of the user who is logged in. 
+ Note that by "logged in" we mean "any login process and open terminal window".


### Terminal:
> root     	==tty2==        2013-10-11 10:00
> sysadmin	==tty1==        2013-10-11 09:58 (:0)
+ This column indicates which terminal window the user is working in.
+ If the terminal name starts with `tty`, then this is an indication of a local login, as this is a regular command line terminal.
+ If the terminal name starts with `pts`, then this indicates the user is using a pseudo terminal or running a process that acts as a terminal.


### Date:
> root     	tty2        ==2013-10-11 10:00==
+ This column indicates when the user logged in.


### Host:
+ After the date and time, some location information may appear. 
+ If the location information contains a hostname, domain name or IP address, then the user has logged in remotely:
> sysadmin 	pts/1       2013-10-11 10:00 ==(example.com)==
+ If there is a colon and a number, then this indicates that they have performed a local graphical login:
> sysadmin     tty1        2013-10-11 09:59 ==(:0)==
+ If no location information is shown in the last column, then this means the user logged in via a local command line process.



## Information about the system:
+ The `who` command has several options for displaying system status information. 
+ For example, the `-b` option shows the last time the system started (booted), and the `-r` option shows the time the system reached the current runlevel:
```
sysadmin@localhost:~$ who -b -r
         system boot  	2013-10-11 09:54
         run-level 5    2013-10-11 09:54
```


## `w` command:
+ The `w` command provides a more detailed list about the users currently on the system than the `who` command.
+ It also provides a summary of the system status. For example:
![[Pasted image 20240228041340.png]]
+ The first line of output from the `w` command is identical to that of the `uptime` command.
+ It shows the current time, how long the system has been running, the total number of users currently logged on and ___the load on the system averaged___ over the last 1, 5 and 15 minute time periods. 


### The load on the system averaged:
+ Load average is CPU utilization where, for a single-core system, a value of 1 would mean 100% CPU usage during that period of time. 
+ For a dual-core system, it would mean 50% CPU usage, and for a quad-core system, it would mean 25% CPU usage.


### The following describes the rest of the output of the `w` command:

|Column|Example|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`USER`|`root`|The name of the user who is logged in.|
|`TTY`|`tty2`|Which terminal window the user is working in.|
|`FROM`|`example.com`|Where the user logged in from.|
|`LOGIN@`|`10:00`|When the user logged in.|
|`IDLE`|`43:44`|How long the user has been idle since the last command was executed.|
|`JCPU`|`0.01s`|The total cpu time used by all processes run since login.|
|`PCPU`|`0.01s`|The total cpu time for the current process.|
|`WHAT`|`-bash`|The current process that the user is running.|
+ The `s` character represents seconds.
