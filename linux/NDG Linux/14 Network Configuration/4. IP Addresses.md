As previously mentioned, hosts address network packets by using the IP address of the destination machine. 

The network packet also includes a return address, which is the IP address of the sending machine.

There are, in fact, two different types of IP addresses: **IPv4** and **IPv6**. 
To understand why there are two different types, you need to understand a brief bit of IP addressing history.

For many years, the IP addressing technique that was used by all computers was IPv4. 
In an IPv4 address, a total of four 8-bit numbers are used to define the address. 
This is considered a 32-bit address (4 x 8 = 32). 
For example:
```
192.168.10.120
```
8-bit refers to numbers from 0 to 255.


Each host on the Internet must have a unique IP address. In an IPv4 environment, there is a technical limit of about 4.3 billion IP addresses. 
However, many of these IP addresses are not usable for various reasons. Also, many organizations haven't made use of all of the IP addresses they have available.

While it seems like there should be plenty of IP addresses to go around, various factors have led to a problem: the Internet started running out of IP addresses.

This issue encouraged the development of IPv6. 
IPv6 was officially created in 1998.
In an IPv6 network the addresses are much larger, 128-bit addresses that look like this:
```
2001:0db8:85a3:0042:1000:8a2e:0370:7334
```


It is important to note that the difference between IPv4 and IPv6 isn't just a larger address pool. IPv6 has many other advanced features that address some of the limitations of IPv4, including better speed, more advanced package management and more efficient data transportation.

Considering all the advantages, you would think that by now all hosts would be using IPv6. However, the majority of network-attached devices in the world still use IPv4 (something like 98-99% of all devices).


## Still v4:
+ Why hasn't the world embraced the superior technology of IPv6?
+ There are primarily two reasons:
	- **NAT:** 
		- Invented to overcome the possibility of running out of IP addresses in an IPv4 environment, Net Address Translation (NAT) used a technique to provide more hosts access to the Internet.
		- In a nutshell, a group of hosts is placed into a private network with no direct access to the Internet; a special router provides Internet access, and only this one router needs an IP address to communicate on the Internet.
		- In other words, a group of hosts shares a single IP address, meaning a lot more computers can attach to the Internet. 
		- This feature means the need to move to IPv6 is less critical than before the invention of NAT.
	- **Porting:** 
		- Porting is switching over from one technology to another.
		- IPv6 has a lot of great new features, but all of the hosts need to be able to utilize these features.
		- Getting everyone on the Internet (or even just some) to make these changes poses a challenge.
