## Distribution:
+ People that say their computer runs Linux usually refer to the kernel, tools, and suite of applications that come bundled together in what is referred to as a distribution.


## Linux Distribution content:
+ Take Linux and the GNU tools, add some user-facing applications like a web browser and an email client, and you have a full Linux system. 
+ Individuals and even companies started bundling all this software into distributions almost as soon as Linux became usable. 
+ The distribution includes tools that take care of setting up the storage, installing the kernel, and installing the rest of the software. 
+ The full-featured distributions also include tools to manage the system and a package manager to help you add and remove software after the installation is complete.


## Why Distributions:
+ Like UNIX, there are distributions suited to every imaginable purpose. 
+ There are distributions that focus on running servers, desktops, or even industry-specific tools such as electronics design or statistical computing. 
+ The major players in the market can be traced back to either Red Hat, Debian or Slackware. 
+ The most visible difference between Red Hat and Debian derivatives is the package manager though there are other differences in everything from file locations to political philosophies.
