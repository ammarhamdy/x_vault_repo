## Closed-source license:
+ Historically, most software has been issued under a closed-source license, meaning that you get the right to use the machine code, but cannot see the source code.
+ Often the license explicitly says that you may not attempt to reverse engineer the machine code back to source code to figure out what it does!


## Open source:
+ The development of Linux closely parallels the rise of open source software.
+ Open source takes a source-centric view of software. The open source philosophy is that you have a right to obtain the software source code and to modify it for your own use.



## Linux open spurce:
+ Linux adopted this philosophy (open source) to great success. 
+ Linus made the source programming code (the instructions a computer uses to operate) freely available, allowing others to join in and shape this fledgling operating system.
+ It was not the first system to be developed by a volunteer (متبرع) group, but since it was built from scratch, early adopters (المتبنين) could influence (تأثير) the project’s direction.
+ People took the source, made changes, and shared them back with the rest of the group, greatly accelerating (تسريع) the pace of development, and ensuring mistakes from other operating systems were not repeated.
