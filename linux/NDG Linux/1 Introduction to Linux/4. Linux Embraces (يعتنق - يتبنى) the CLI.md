## Graphical user interface (GUI):
+ There are two basic types of interfaces available that allow you to interact with the operating system.
+ The typical computer user today is most familiar with a graphical user interface (GUI).
+ In a GUI, applications present themselves in windows that can be resized and moved around.
+ There are menus and tools to help users navigate.
+ Graphical applications include web browsers, graphics editing tools and email, to name a few.


## Command line interface (CLI):
+ The second type of interface is the command line interface (CLI), a text-based interface to the computer.
+ The CLI relies primarily on keyboard input.
+ Everything the user wants the computer to do is relayed by typing commands rather than clicking on icons. 
+ ==It can be said that when a user clicks on an icon, the computer is telling the user what to do, but, when the user types a command, they are telling the computer what to do.==
