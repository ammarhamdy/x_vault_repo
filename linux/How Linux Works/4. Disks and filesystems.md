## Partition:
+ Partitions are subdivisions of the whole disk.
+ On Linux, they’re denoted with a number after the whole block device, so they have names like `/dev/sda1` and `/dev/sdb3`.
+ The kernel presents each partition as a block device, just as it would an entire disk.
+ Partitions are defined on a small area of the disk called a partition table (also called a disk label).


## File system:
+ The next layer up from the partition is the filesystem, the database of files and directories that you’re accustomed to interacting with in user space.
+ In computing, a file system or filesystem (often abbreviated to fs) ==controls how data is stored and retrieved==. 
+ Without 	a file system, data placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins.
+ The file system is responsible for organizing files and directories.
+ As files are deleted, the space they were allocated eventually is considered available for use by other files

## To find a file:
+ If you want to access the data in a file, you need to use the appropriate partition location from the partition table and then search the filesystem database on that partition for the desired file data.


## TO access data on a disk:

# 4.1 Partitioning Disk Devices


+ There’s nothing special about a partition table—it’s just a bunch of data that says how the blocks on the disk are divided.
+ The traditional table, dating back to the PC days, is the one found inside the ==Master Boot Record== (`MBR`), and it has many limitations.
+ Most newer systems use the Globally Unique ==Identifier Partition Table== (`GPT`).


### Some Linux partitioning tools:
+ parted (“partition editor”) A text-based tool that supports both `MBR` and `GPT`.
+ `gparted` A graphical version of parted.
+ `fdisk` The traditional text-based Linux disk partitioning tool. Recent versions of `fdisk` support the `MBR`, `GPT`, and many other kinds of partition tables, but older versions were limited to `MBR` support.
+ We’ll use `parted` to display partition tables. 
+ However, when creating and altering partition tables, we’ll use `fdisk`.


### ==Partitioning and filesystem==:
+ There’s a critical difference between partitioning and filesystem manipulation: the partition table defines simple boundaries on the disk, whereas a filesystem is a much more involved متضمن data system. 
+ For this reason, we’ll use separate tools for partitioning and creating `filesystems`.


## 4.1.1 Viewing a Partition Table:
+ You can view your system’s partition table with `parted -l`. 
+ This sample output shows two disk devices with two different kinds of partition tables:
+ ![[Pasted image 20231018203010.png]]
+ The first device (`/dev/sda`) uses the traditional `GPT` partition table, and the second (`/dev/sdf`) contains a `GPT`.


### Watch out for the unit sizes:
+ Watch out for the unit sizes when reading partition tables. 
+ The parted output shows an approximated size based on what parted thinks is easiest to read. 
+ On the other hand, `fdisk -l` shows an exact number, but in most cases, the units are 512-byte “sectors,” which can be confusing because it might look like you’ve doubled the actual sizes of your disk and partitions.
+ A close look at the `fdisk` partition table view also reveals the sector size information.


#### `MBR` Basics:
+ ![[Pasted image 20231018203634.png]]
+ ![[Pasted image 20231018203647.png]]
+ The first device (`/dev/sda`) uses the traditional `MBR` partition table (which parted calls `msdos`)
+ The `MBR` table in this example contains primary, extended, and logical partitions.
+ A primary partition is a normal subdivision of the disk; partition 1 is an example. 
+ The basic `MBR` has a limit of four primary partitions, so if you want more than four, you must designate one as an extended partition. 
+ An extended partition breaks down into logical partitions, which the operating system can then use as it would any other partition.
+ In this example, partition 2 is an extended partition that contains logical partition 5.
