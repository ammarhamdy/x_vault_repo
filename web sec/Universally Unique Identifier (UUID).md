**Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)**


**Format:** 
It's a 36-character string consisting of hexadecimal digits (0-9 and a-f) separated by hyphens.
The general format is: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`, where each `x` represents a hexadecimal digit.

**Purpose:** 
UUIDs are designed to be ==globally== unique. 
This means that the probability of generating the same UUID twice is extremely low, even across different systems, organizations, or time periods.


**Structure:** 
The different parts of a UUID have specific meanings, although the exact generation method can vary depending on the version of the UUID. 
Generally: 
+ The first few segments often contain information related to the timestamp and the node (e.g., the MAC address of the computer).
+ The middle segments help ensure uniqueness.


## Individual Sections
The exact generation method and the meaning of each section can vary slightly depending on the UUID version.

**First Group - 8 Hexadecimal Digits**
This is the first and often the most significant part.
In many UUID generation algorithms (especially version 1 and 4), this part contributes to the overall uniqueness and often includes bits related to the timestamp or random values.

**Second Group - 4 Hexadecimal Digits**
This group also contributes to the uniqueness.
In version 1 UUIDs, this section often contains more bits from the timestamp.

**Third Group - 4 Hexadecimal Digits**
This group is particularly important as it often contains the **version number** of the UUID.
- **Version 1:** Indicates a UUID generated based on the time and the computer's network address (MAC address).
- **Version 3:** Indicates a UUID generated by hashing a name using MD5.
- **Version 4:** Indicates a UUID generated using random or pseudo-random numbers.
- **Version 5:** Indicates a UUID generated by hashing a name using SHA-1.
- **The specific bit pattern within this group identifies the generation method.**

**Fourth Group - 4 Hexadecimal Digits**
This group often contains bits that further contribute to uniqueness and might include clock sequence information (used in version 1 to handle potential clock resets).

**Fifth Group - 12 Hexadecimal Digits**
This is the final and longest group.
In version 1 UUIDs, this often includes the node identifier, which is typically derived from the MAC address of the computer.
In version 4 UUIDs, this is mostly random bits.



## Specific UUID Versions and Their Meaning
It's crucial to understand that the exact meaning of each section depends on the **version** of the UUID being generated. 

**Version 1 (Time-Based):**
- Uses the current time and the MAC address of the computer to generate a unique identifier.
- The first few segments are derived from the timestamp.
- The last segment contains the node identifier (MAC address).
- **The version number in the third group will be `1`.**




## UUID generator

```sh
uuidgen
```

```python
import uuid
print(uuid.uuid4())  # Generates a random UUID (version 4)
print(uuid.uuid1())  # Generates a UUID based on the host ID and timestamp (version 1)
```

```java
import java.util.UUID;

public class UUIDGenerator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UUID uuid = UUID.randomUUID();
        System.out.println(uuid.toString());
    }
}
```

```js
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');
console.log(uuidv4()); // Generates a random UUID (version 4)
```
