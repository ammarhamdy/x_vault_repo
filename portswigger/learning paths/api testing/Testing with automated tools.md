Burp includes automated tools that can help you detect server-side parameter pollution vulnerabilities.

These occur when an application receives user input, transforms it in some way, then performs further processing on the result. 

This behavior doesn't necessarily constitute a vulnerability, so you'll need to do further testing using the manual techniques outlined above.

For more information, see the Suspicious input transformation issue definition.
