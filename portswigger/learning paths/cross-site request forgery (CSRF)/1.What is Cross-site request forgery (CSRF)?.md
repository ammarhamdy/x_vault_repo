Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to [induce](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=induce&op=translate) (force) users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. 

It allows an attacker to partly [circumvent](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=circumvent&op=translate) the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.
