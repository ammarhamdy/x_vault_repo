SameSite is ==**a browser security mechanism**== that determines when a website's cookies are included in requests [originating](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=originating&op=translate) from other websites. 
SameSite cookie restrictions provide ==**partial** protection== against a variety of cross-site attacks, including CSRF, cross-site leaks, and some CORS exploits.

Since 2021, Chrome applies `Lax` SameSite restrictions by default if the website that issues the cookie doesn't explicitly set its own restriction level. 
This is a proposed standard, and we expect other major browsers to adopt this behavior in the future. 
As a result, it's essential to have [solid grasp](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=solid%20grasp&op=translate) of how these restrictions work, as well as how they can potentially be bypassed, in order to thoroughly test for cross-site attack vectors.

We'll then look at some of the most common ways you may be able to bypass these restrictions, enabling CSRF and other cross-site attacks on websites that may initially appear secure.

# What is a site in the context of SameSite cookies?

In the context of SameSite cookie restrictions, ==**a site is defined as**== ___the top-level domain (`TLD`), usually something like `.com` or `.net`, plus one additional level of the domain name___. 

```
site = scheme + TLD+1
```

This is often referred to as the `TLD+1`.

When determining whether a request is same-site or not, the URL scheme is also taken into consideration. 

This means that a link from `http://app.example.com` to `https://app.example.com` is treated as cross-site by most browsers.

#### Note
You may come across the term "==**effective top-level domain**==" (`eTLD`).
This is just a way of accounting for the reserved multipart suffixes that are treated as top-level domains in practice, such as `.co.uk`.

# What's the difference between a site and an origin?


The difference between a site and an origin is their scope; **==a site encompasses multiple domain names==**, whereas **==an origin only includes one==**. 

Although they're closely related, it's important not to use the terms interchangeably as conflating the two can have serious security implications.

**==Two URLs are considered to have the same origin if they share the exact same scheme, domain name, and port.==** 

Although note that the port is often [inferred](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=inferred&op=translate) from the scheme.

As you can see from this example, the term "**==site==**" ___is much less specific as it only accounts for the scheme and last part of the domain name___. 
Crucially, this means that a cross-origin request can still be same-site, but not the other way around.

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Request from**|**Request to**|**Same-site?**|**Same-origin?**|
|`https://example.com`|`https://example.com`|Yes|Yes|
|`https://app.example.com`|`https://intranet.example.com`|Yes|No: mismatched domain name|
|`https://example.com`|`https://example.com:8080`|Yes|No: mismatched port|
|`https://example.com`|`https://example.co.uk`|No: mismatched eTLD|No: mismatched domain name|
|`https://example.com`|`http://example.com`|No: mismatched scheme|No: mismatched scheme|

This is an important distinction as it means that any vulnerability enabling arbitrary JavaScript execution can be abused to bypass site-based defenses on other domains belonging to the same site.
