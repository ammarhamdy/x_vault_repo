If a cookie is set with the `SameSite=Strict` attribute, browsers won't include it in any cross-site requests. 

You may be able to get around this limitation if you can find a [gadget](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=gadget&op=translate) that results in a secondary request within the same site.

One possible gadget is a client-side redirect that dynamically constructs the redirection target using attacker-controllable input like URL parameters see [DOM-based open redirection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dom-based/open-redirection).
