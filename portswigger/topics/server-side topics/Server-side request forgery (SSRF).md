# SSRF with blacklist-based input filters

Some applications block input containing hostnames like `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, or sensitive URLs like `/admin`. In this situation, you can often circumvent the filter using the following techniques:

- Use an alternative IP representation of `127.0.0.1`, such as `2130706433`, `017700000001`, or `127.1`.
- Register your own domain name that resolves to `127.0.0.1`. You can use `spoofed.burpcollaborator.net` for this purpose.
- Obfuscate blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation.
- Provide a URL that you control, which redirects to the target URL. Try using different redirect codes, as well as different protocols for the target URL. For example, switching from an `http:` to `https:` URL during the redirect has been shown to bypass some anti-SSRF filters.


# Lab: SSRF with blacklist-based input filter
## My solution:
```http
HTTP://LOCALHOST/ADMIN/delete?username=carlos
```
## Port swigger solution 
1. Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
2. Change the URL in the `stockApi` parameter to `http://127.0.0.1/` and observe that the request is blocked.
3. Bypass the block by changing the URL to: `http://127.1/`
4. Change the URL to `http://127.1/admin` and observe that the URL is blocked again.
5. Obfuscate the "a" (character 'a') by double-URL encoding it to %2561 to access the admin interface and delete the target user:

>$ decode -t url %2561
%61
>$ decode -t url %61
a
