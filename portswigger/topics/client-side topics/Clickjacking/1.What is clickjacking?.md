# Clickjacking (UI redressing)
Clickjacking is an interface-based attack in which a user is tricked into clicking on actionable content on a hidden website by clicking on some other content in a decoy website. 

Consider the following example:
A web user accesses a decoy website and clicks on a button to win a prize. Unknowingly, they have been deceived by an attacker into pressing an alternative hidden button and this results in the payment of an account on another site.

The technique depends upon the incorporation of an invisible, actionable web page (or multiple pages) containing a button or hidden link, say, within an iframe.

The iframe is overlaid on top of the user's anticipated decoy web page content. 

This attack differs from a [CSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) attack in that the user is required to perform an action such as a button click whereas a CSRF attack depends upon forging an entire request without the user's knowledge or input.

 Clickjacking attacks are not mitigated by the CSRF token as a target session is established with content loaded from an authentic website and with all requests happening on-domain.

 CSRF tokens are placed into requests and passed to the server as part of a normally behaved session. 
 The difference compared to a normal user session is that the process occurs within a hidden `iframe`.
