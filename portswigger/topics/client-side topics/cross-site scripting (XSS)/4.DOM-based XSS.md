# What is DOM-based cross-site scripting?
DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities usually arise when JavaScript takes data from an attacker-controllable source, such as the URL, and passes it to a sink that supports dynamic code execution, such as `eval()` or `innerHTML`.

This enables attackers to execute malicious JavaScript, which typically allows them to hijack other users' accounts.

==To deliver a DOM-based XSS attack, you need to place data into a source so that it is propagated to a sink and causes execution of arbitrary JavaScript==.

The most common source for DOM XSS is the URL, which is typically accessed with the `window.location` object. 

An attacker can construct a link to send a victim to a vulnerable page with a payload in the query string and fragment portions of the URL. 

In certain circumstances, such as when targeting a 404 page or a website running PHP, the payload can also be placed in the path.


# How to test for DOM-based cross-site scripting
The majority of DOM XSS vulnerabilities can be found quickly and reliably using Burp Suite's web vulnerability scanner.

To test for DOM-based cross-site scripting manually, you generally need to use a browser with developer tools, such as Chrome. 
You need to work through each available source in turn, and test each one individually.

## Testing HTML sinks
To test for DOM XSS in an HTML sink, place a random alphanumeric string into the source (such as `location.search`), then use developer tools to inspect the HTML and find where your string appears.

Note that the browser's "View source" option won't work for DOM XSS testing because it doesn't take account of changes that have been performed in the HTML by JavaScript. 
In Chrome's developer tools, you can use `Control+F`  to search the DOM for your string.

## Testing JavaScript execution sinks
Testing JavaScript execution sinks for DOM-based XSS is a little harder. 
With these sinks, your input doesn't necessarily appear anywhere within the DOM, so you can't search for it. 
Instead you'll need to use the JavaScript debugger to determine whether and how your input is sent to a sink.

For each potential source, such as `location`, you first need to find cases within the page's JavaScript code where the source is being referenced. In Chrome's developer tools, you can use `Control+Shift+F` to search all the page's JavaScript code for the source.

Once you've found where the source is being read, you can use the JavaScript debugger to add a break point and follow how the source's value is used. 

You might find that the source gets assigned to other variables. If this is the case, you'll need to use the search function again to track these variables and see if they're passed to a sink. 

When you find a sink that is being assigned data that originated from the source, you can use the debugger to inspect the value by hovering over the variable to show its value before it is sent to the sink. 

Then, as with HTML sinks, you need to refine your input to see if you can deliver a successful XSS attack.

## Testing for DOM XSS using DOM Invader
You can take advantage of its built-in DOM Invader extension, which does a lot of the hard work for you.

# Exploiting DOM XSS with different sources and sinks
In principle, a website is vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting if there is an executable path via which data can propagate from source to sink.

In practice, different sources and sinks have differing properties and behavior that can affect exploitability, and determine what techniques are necessary.

The `document.write` sink works with `script` elements, so you can use a simple payload, such as the one below:
```html
document.write('... <script>alert(document.domain)</script> ...');
```

# Sources and sinks in third-party dependencies
Modern web applications are typically built using a number of third-party libraries and frameworks, which often provide additional functions and capabilities for developers. 
It's important to remember that some of these are also potential sources and sinks for DOM XSS.


## DOM XSS in jQuery
If a JavaScript library such as jQuery is being used, look out for sinks that can alter DOM elements on the page. 
For instance, jQuery's `attr()` function can change the attributes of DOM elements. If data is read from a user-controlled source like the URL, then passed to the `attr()` function, then it may be possible to manipulate the value sent to cause XSS. 
For example, here we have some JavaScript that changes an anchor element's `href` attribute using data from the URL:
```js
$(function() {
	$('#backLink').attr("href",(new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('returnUrl'));
});
```
You can exploit this by modifying the URL so that the `location.search` source contains a malicious JavaScript URL. 
After the page's JavaScript applies this malicious URL to the back link's `href`, clicking on the back link will execute it:
```js
?returnUrl=javascript:alert(document.domain)
```


### [LAB](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-jquery-href-attribute-sink)
This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the submit feedback page. It uses the jQuery library's `$` selector function to find an anchor element, and changes its `href` attribute using data from `location.search`.

To solve this lab, make the "back" link alert `document.cookie`.

`jQuery` used to be extremely popular, and a classic DOM XSS vulnerability was caused by websites using this selector in conjunction with the `location.hash` source for animations or auto-scrolling to a particular element on the page. 
This behavior was often implemented using a vulnerable `hashchange` event handler, similar to the following:
```js
$(window).on('hashchange', function() {
	var element = $(location.hash);
	element[0].scrollIntoView();
});
```

As the `hash` is user controllable, an attacker could use this to inject an XSS vector into the `$()` selector sink.
More recent versions of jQuery have patched this particular vulnerability by preventing you from injecting HTML into a selector when the input begins with a hash character (`#`).

To actually exploit this classic vulnerability, you'll need to find a way to trigger a `hashchange` event without user interaction. 
One of the simplest ways of doing this is to deliver your exploit via an `iframe`:
```html
<iframe 
	src="https://vulnerable-website.com#" 
	onload="this.src+='<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>'"
>
```
In this example, the `src` attribute points to the vulnerable page with an empty hash value. 
When the `iframe` is loaded, an XSS vector is appended to the hash, causing the `hashchange` event to fire.

#### Note
Even newer versions of `jQuery` can still be vulnerable via the `$()` selector sink, provided you have full control over its input from a source that doesn't require a `#` prefix.


## DOM XSS in `AngularJS`
If a framework like `AngularJS` is used, it may be possible to execute JavaScript without angle brackets or events. 
When a site uses the `ng-app` attribute on an HTML element, it will be processed by `AngularJS`.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html lang="en-US">  
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>  
<body>  
  
<div ng-app="">  
  <p>Name : <input type="text" ng-model="name"></p>  
  <h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>  
</div>  
  
</body>  
</html>
```
In this case, `AngularJS` will execute JavaScript inside double curly braces that can occur directly in HTML or inside attributes.

# DOM XSS combined with reflected and stored data
Some pure DOM-based vulnerabilities are self-contained within a single page. If a script reads some data from the URL and writes it to a dangerous sink, then the vulnerability is entirely client-side.

However, sources aren't limited to data that is directly exposed by browsers - they can also originate from the website. 
For example, websites often reflect URL parameters in the HTML response from the server. 
This is commonly associated with normal XSS, but it can also lead to reflected DOM XSS vulnerabilities.

In a reflected DOM XSS vulnerability, the server processes data from the request, and echoes the data into the response. 
The reflected data might be placed into a JavaScript string literal, or a data item within the DOM, such as a form field. 
A script on the page then processes the reflected data in an unsafe way, ultimately writing it to a dangerous sink.
```js
eval('var data = "reflected string"');
```

# Which sinks can lead to DOM-XSS vulnerabilities?
The following are some of the main sinks that can lead to DOM-XSS vulnerabilities:
```
document.write()
document.writeln()
document.domain
element.innerHTML
element.outerHTML
element.insertAdjacentHTML
element.onevent
```
The following `jQuery` functions are also sinks that can lead to DOM-XSS vulnerabilities:
```
add()
after()
append()
animate()
insertAfter()
insertBefore()
before()
html()
prepend()
replaceAll()
replaceWith()
wrap()
wrapInner()
wrapAll()
has()
constructor()
init()
index()
jQuery.parseHTML()
$.parseHTML()
```
