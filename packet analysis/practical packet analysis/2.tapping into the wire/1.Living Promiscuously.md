Before you can sniff packets on a network, you need a network interface card (NIC) that supports a [promiscuous](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=promiscuous&op=translate) mode driver.

==Promiscuous mode is what allows a NIC to view all packets crossing the wire.==

When operating in promiscuous mode, the NIC passes every packet it sees to the host’s processor, regardless of addressing.

Most modern NICs support promiscuous mode, and `Wireshark` includes the `libpcap`/`WinPcap` driver, which allows it to switch your NIC directly into promiscuous mode from the Wireshark GUI.

The only time you don’t need to sniff in promiscuous mode is when you want to see only the traffic sent directly to the MAC address of the interface from which you are sniffing.
