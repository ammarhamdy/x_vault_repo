Traffic sent through a hub goes through every port connected to that hub.

Therefore, to analyze the traffic running through a computer connected to a hub, all you need to do is connect a packet sniffer to an empty port on the hub. 

You’ll be able to see all communication to and from that computer, as well as all communication between any other devices plugged into that hub.

Since only one device can communicate through a hub at any one time, a connected device must compete for bandwidth with all the other devices trying to communicate.
