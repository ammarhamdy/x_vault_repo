# Find packet

Finding Packets To find packets that match particular criteria, open the Find Packet bar by pressing `ctrl-F`.

The Display filter option allows you to enter an expression-based filter that will find only those packets that satisfy that expression.

The String option searches for packets with a text string you specify.


# Marking Packets

After you have found packets that match your criterion, you can mark those of particular interest. 

For example, marking packets will let you save only these packets.

To mark a packet, either right-click it in the Packet List pane and 
choose Mark Packet from the pop-up or click a packet in the Packet List 
pane and press `ctrl-M`.

You can mark as many packets as you wish in a capture. To jump forward and backward between marked packets, press `shift-ctrl-N` and `shift-ctrl-B`, respectively.


# Printing Packets

Being able to print packets to a PDF file is also very convenient, especially when preparing reports.

To print captured packets, open the Print dialog by choosing `File` > `Print` from the main menu.
