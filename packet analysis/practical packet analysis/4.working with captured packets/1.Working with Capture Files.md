# Saving and Exporting Capture Files

In many cases, you may only want to save a subset of the packets in your capture. 
To do so, select `File` > `Export Specified Packets`.

To export your packet capture in one of these formats (plain text, CSV, ), choose `File` >` Export Packet Dissections` and then select the format for the exported file.


# Merging Capture Files

You can also merge multiple capture files.

This is a common practice when comparing two data streams or combining streams of the same traffic that were captured separately.

To merge capture files, open one of the files you want to merge and choose `File` > `Merge` to bring up the Merge with capture file dialog

You can prepend the selected file to the currently open one, append it, or merge the files chronologically based on their timestamps.
