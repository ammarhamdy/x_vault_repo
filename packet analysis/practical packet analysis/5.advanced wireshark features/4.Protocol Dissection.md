You can think of a dissector as the translator between raw data and the Wireshark program. 

For a protocol to be supported by Wireshark, it must have a dissector (or you can write your own).

==**Wireshark uses dissectors to detect individual protocols and decide how to display network information.**==

Unfortunately, Wireshark doesn’t always make the right choices when selecting the dissector to use on a packet. This is especially true when a protocol on the network is using a nonstandard configuration, such as a non-default port
When Wireshark incorrectly applies dissectors, it’s possible to override this selection.


# Viewing Dissector Source Code

Examining the source code of protocol dissectors can be done directly from the Wireshark website by clicking the Develop link and clicking Browse the Code. 

This link will send you to the Wireshark code repository, where you can view the release code for recent Wireshark versions. 

The protocol dissectors are in the `epan/dissectors` folder, and each dissector is labeled `packets-.c`
