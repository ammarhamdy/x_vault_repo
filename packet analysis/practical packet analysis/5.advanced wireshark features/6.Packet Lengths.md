The size of a single packet or group of packets can tell you a lot about a situation.

Under normal circumstances, the maximum size of a **==frame on an Ethernet==** network is **==1,518 bytes.==** 

==When you subtract the Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers from this number, you are left with ==**==1,460 bytes==** that can be used for the transmission of a layer 7 protocol header or for data. 

If you know the minimum requirements for packet transmission, you can begin to look at the distribution of packet lengths in a capture to make educated guesses about the makeup of the traffic.

Let’s look at an example by opening the file `download-slow.pcapng`. 
Once it is open, select `Statistics > Packet Lengths`.

Pay special attention to the row showing statistics for packets ranging from 1,280 to 2,559 bytes. 
Larger packets like these typically indicate the transfer of data, whereas smaller packets indicate protocol control sequences.

Larger packets like these typically indicate the transfer of data, whereas smaller packets indicate protocol control sequences.

Most of the remaining packets (33.44 percent) are in the 40- to 79-byte range. 
Packets in this range are usually TCP control packets that don’t carry data.


Let’s consider the typical size of protocol headers. 
The Ethernet header is ==14 bytes== (plus a 4-byte CRC), the IP header is a minimum of ==20== bytes, and a TCP packet with no data or options is also ==20== bytes. 
```
14+20+20 = 54
```
This means that standard `TCP` control packets—such as `SYN`, `ACK`, `RST`, and `FIN` packets—will be around ==54== bytes and fall in this range.
