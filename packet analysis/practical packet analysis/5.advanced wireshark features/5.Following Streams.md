One of Wireshark’s most satisfying analysis features is its ability to ==**reassemble data from multiple packets into a consolidated**==, easily readable format, often called a _packet transcript_.

So you don’t have to view data being sent from client to server in a bunch of small chunks while clicking from packet to packet, stream following sorts the data to make it easier to view. 

Four types of streams are available to follow: 

**TCP stream** Assembles data from protocols that [utilize](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=utilize&op=translate) TCP, such as HTTP and FTP. 

**UDP stream** Assembles data from protocols that [utilize](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ar&text=utilize&op=translate) UDP, such as DNS. 

**SSL stream** Assembles data from protocols that are encrypted, such as HTTPS. 
You must supply keys to decrypt the traffic. 

**HTTP stream** Assembles and decompresses data from the HTTP protocol. 
This is useful when following HTTP data via TCP stream doesn’t decode the HTTP payload fully.

Click any of the TCP or HTTP packets in the file, right-click the packet, and ==choose Follow **TCP Stream**.==
This will consolidate the TCP stream and open the conversation transcript in a separate window:

The text displayed in this window is in two colors, with ==red text signifying traffic from source to destination and blue text identifying traffic in the opposite direction==, from destination to source.

The communication in the TCP stream begins with an initial GET request for the web root directory (/) and a response from the server that the request was successful in the form of an `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`.


## Following SSL Streams

Following TCP and UDP streams is a simple two-click operation, but viewing SSL (**Secure Sockets Layer**) streams in a readable format requires a few additional steps.

Because the traffic is encrypted, you are required to supply the private key associated with the server responsible for the encrypted traffic.
The method you will use to retrieve this key varies depending on the server technology in use.
but once you have it, you will have to load it into Wireshark using the following process:
1. Access your Wireshark preferences by clicking Edit > Preferences. 
2. Expand the Protocols section and click the SSL protocol heading. 
	+ Click the Edit button next to the RSA keys list label. 
3. Click the plus (+) button. 
4. Supply the required information. 
	+ This includes the IP address of the server responsible for the encryption, the port, the protocol, the location of the key file, and a password for the key file if one was used.
5. Restart Wireshark.
