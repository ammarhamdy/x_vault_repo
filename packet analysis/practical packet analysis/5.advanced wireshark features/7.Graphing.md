# Round-Trip Time Graphing

Another graphing feature of Wireshark is the ability to view a plot of round trip times for a given capture file. 

The round-trip time (`RTT`) is the time it takes for an acknowledgment to be received for a packet. 

Effectively, ==**this is the time it took your packet to get to its destination and for the acknowledgment of that packet to be sent back to you**==.

Analysis of `RTT`s is often done to find slow points or bottlenecks in communication and to determine whether there is any latency.

Let’s try out this feature. 
Open the file download-fast.pcapng. 
View the RTT graph of this file by selecting a TCP packet and then choosing `Statistics > TCP StreamGraphs > Round Trip Time Graph`.

Each point in the graph represents the RTT of a packet. 
The default view shows these values sorted by sequence number.


# Flow Graphing

The flow graph feature is useful for visualizing connections and showing the flow of data over time, information that makes it easier to understand how devices are communicating. 

A flow graph contains a column-based view of a connection between hosts and organizes the traffic so you can interpret it visually.

To create a flow graph, open the file `dns_recursivequery_server.pcapng` and select `Statistics > Flow Graph`.

This flow graph is a recursive DNS query, which is a DNS query that is received by one host and forwarded to another.

Each vertical line in the graph represents an individual host.
