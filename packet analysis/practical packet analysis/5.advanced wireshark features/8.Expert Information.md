The dissectors for each protocol in Wireshark define expert info that can be used to alert you about particular states within packets of that protocol. 

These states are separated into four categories.

**Chat** Basic information about the communication 

**Note** Unusual packets that may be part of normal communication 

**Warning** Unusual packets that are most likely not part of normal communication 

**Error** An error in a packet or the dissector interpreting it


For example, open the file `download-slow.pcapng`. 
Then click Analyze and select Expert Information to bring up the Expert Information window.

At this time, there are 29 expert info messages configured for TCP:

## Chat Messages 

**Window Update** 
Sent by a receiver to notify a sender that the size of the TCP receive window has changed.


## Note Messages

**TCP Retransmission** 
Results from packet loss.
==Occurs when a duplicate ACK is received or the retransmission timer of a packet expires.==

**Duplicate ACK** 
When a host doesn’t receive the next sequence number it is expecting, it generates a duplicate ACK of the last data it received.

**Zero Window Probe** 
Monitors the status of the TCP receive window after a zero window packet has been transmitted.

**Keep Alive ACK** 
Sent in response to keep-alive packets.

**Zero Window Probe ACK**
Sent in response to zero-window-probe packets.

**Window Is Full** 
Notifies a transmitting host that the receiver’s TCP receive window is full.


## Warning Messages

**Previous Segment Lost** 
Indicates packet loss. 
Occurs when an expected sequence number in a data stream is skipped.

**ACKed Lost Packet** 
Occurs when an ACK packet is seen but the packet it is acknowledging is not.

**Keep Alive**
Triggered when a connection keep-alive packet is seen.

**Zero Window** 
Seen when the size of the TCP receive window is reached and a zero window notice is sent out, requesting that the ==sender stop sending data==.

**Out-of-Order** 
Utilizes sequence numbers to detect when packets are received out of sequence.

**Fast Retransmission** 
A retransmission that occurs within 20 milliseconds of a duplicate ACK.
