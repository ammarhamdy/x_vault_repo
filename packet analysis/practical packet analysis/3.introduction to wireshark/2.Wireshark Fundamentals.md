## Configuration Files

t’s helpful to understand where Wireshark stores various configuration settings should you ever need to modify those files directly. 

You can find the location of the Wireshark configuration files by selecting Help from the main drop-down menu, choosing About Wireshark, and clicking the Folders tab.


The two most important locations in terms of Wireshark customization are the personal and global configuration directories. 

**The global configuration directory** contains all of the default settings for Wireshark and is where the default profile stores its settings. 

**The personal configuration folder** contains customized settings and profiles unique to your account.
Any new profiles you create will be stored in a subdirectory of the personal configuration folder using whatever name you provide.
