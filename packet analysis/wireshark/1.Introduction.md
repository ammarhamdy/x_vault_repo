# What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is a network packet analyzer. 
A network packet analyzer presents captured packet data in as much detail as possible.


## Here are some reasons people use Wireshark:

Network administrators use it to troubleshoot network problems 

Network security engineers use it to examine security problems  

QA engineers use it to verify network applications 

Developers use it to debug protocol implementations 

People use it to learn network protocol internals


## Features

Available for UNIX and Windows.

Capture live packet data from a network interface. 

Open files containing packet data captured with `tcpdump`/`WinDump`, Wireshark, and many other packet capture programs.

Import packets from text files containing hex dumps of packet data. 

Display packets with very detailed protocol information. 

Save packet data captured. 

Export some or all packets in a number of capture file formats. 

Filter packets on many criteria.

Search for packets on many criteria. 

Colorize packet display based on filters. 

Create various statistics. 

…and a lot more


## Live capture from many different network media
Wireshark can capture traffic from many different network media types, including 
+ Ethernet, 
+ Wireless LAN, 
+ Bluetooth, 
+ USB, 
+ and more.
An overview of the supported media types can be found at:
https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/NetworkMedia.


## Open Source Software
Wireshark is an open source software project, and is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).


## System Requirements
Although Wireshark uses a separate process to capture packets, ==**the packet analysis is single-threaded and won’t benefit much from multi-core systems**==.


## Where To Get Wireshark

You can get the latest copy of the program from the Wireshark website at 
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.


## Website 
You will find lots of useful information on the Wireshark homepage at
https://www.wireshark.org/. 

## Wiki 
The Wireshark Wiki at
https://wiki.wireshark.org/ 
provides a wide range of information related to Wireshark and packet capture in general.


## Installing the binaries under UNIX
Installing from debs under Debian, Ubuntu and other Debian derivatives.
If you can just install from the repository then use: 
```
apt install wireshark
```
By installing Wireshark packages non-root, users won’t gain rights automatically to capture packets. 
To allow non-root users to capture packets follow the procedure described in 
https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/blob/master/packaging/debian/README.Debian 
(`/usr/share/doc/wireshark-common/README.Debian.gz`)
