# Security engineering

This section refers to the technical implementation of various forms of security.

- [Information security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-information-security-infosec.html), or InfoSec, protects data in any form from being accessed, modified, shared, or deleted by the wrong people.

- [Network security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-network-security.html?dtid=osscdc000283) is concerned with the network infrastructure of an organization that guards against unauthorized access or data from being intercepted.

- [Application security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/security/application-first-security/what-is-application-security.html) refers to implementing measures that defend an application (mobile, desktop, or web) from attack, including both software and hardware solutions. Examples of application security include secure coding, the use of antivirus programs, firewalls, and encryption.

- [Cloud security](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/cloud.html) refers to the new field of making sure resources uploaded into the cloud are secure. Companies and users are constantly moving more resources into the cloud, and professionals in this field need to be familiar with implementing security in this environment.

- [Cryptography](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cryptography) focuses on methods to **hide and un-hide information** so that data is only readable or usable by authorized people. This requires familiarity with all types of encryption and hashing algorithms.

- [Critical infrastructure security](https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/critical-infrastructure-protection-cip) is defending physical systems that are becoming more digital/networked, such as energy grids, hospitals, water and waste systems, and even schools. Among the issues that come up are natural disasters and outages.


# Security operations

People who work in this area are responsible for implementing security principles, monitoring for incidents, and recovering from disasters. 

They work closely with everyone under the security umbrella to:
- Detect when something has gone wrong.
- Implement preventative measures against cyber attacks.
- Make sure there are back-ups in case a system is compromised and data is lost.
- Track changes to a system.
- Come up with disaster recovery plans in advance
- Create documents and organization policies for all of the above.
