# 🛡️ What is WAF?

==**WAF** = **Web Application Firewall**==

A **WAF** protects **web applications** by filtering and monitoring **HTTP/S traffic**.
It's specifically designed to **detect and block attacks** like:
- **SQL injection**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Remote file inclusion**
- **Path traversal**, etc.


## How it works:
- WAFs sit **in front of a web server** (like a reverse proxy).
- They **inspect incoming requests** and **apply rules** to block malicious ones.


## Examples of WAFs:
- **Cloud-based**: Cloudflare, AWS WAF, Azure WAF
- **On-premises**: ModSecurity (open source), F5, Imperva
