# 🛡️ What is IPS?

==**IPS** = **Intrusion Prevention System**==

An **IPS** protects an **entire network or system**, not just web applications.
It monitors **network traffic in real time** to detect and prevent:
- Malware
- Port scanning        
- Exploits (e.g., buffer overflows)
- Brute-force attacks
- Network-based SQLi or RCE


## How it works:
- Can be **network-based (NIPS)** or **host-based (HIPS)**.
- Looks for **known attack signatures** or **anomalous behavior**.
- Can **block, log, or alert** on malicious activity.


##  Examples of IPS:
- Snort
- Suricata
- Cisco Firepower
- Palo Alto Threat Prevention
