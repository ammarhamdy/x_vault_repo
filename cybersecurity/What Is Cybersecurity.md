 CIA stands for Confidentiality السرية, Integrity السلامة, and Availability.

## Integrity

Integrity refers to data integrity here. 

We need security controls that protect data from being changed or deleted. 

We must also ensure that the damage can be reversed if data was changed accidentally or by the wrong person. 

Some techniques related to integrity are:
- Keeping backups of the data in its correct state, and logging versions
- Using cryptography to securely check for changes
- Keeping track of digital signatures to prove integrity of data
