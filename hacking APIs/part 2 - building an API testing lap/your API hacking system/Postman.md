## Environments

An environment provides a way to store and use the same variables across APIs. 

An environmental variable is a value that will replace a variable across an environment.

You can give an environment variable both an initial value and a current value ==**An initial value** will be shared if you share your
Postman environment with a team, whereas a **current value** is not shared and is only stored locally==.
